## Description

The (imaginary) movie streaming platform _MovIndie_ needs help! The company is renown for their handpicked selection of independent movies available for streaming on their website, but due to the ever-growing number of movie releases, itâ€™s becoming more and more time-consuming for the small team to make noteworthy picks. In order to simplify this process, they would like to use an interactive tool that can help in the pre-selection process of their movies. 

This project involves web scraping, using different APIs, cleaning and analyzing all the data, and finally creating a dashboard that can be filtered by multiple metrics (genre, director, language, keyword etc.) to serve the company's purpose.

## Data Sources

IMDb is the largest online movie database including information on half a million movies. To find movies relevant for this project, I have initially scraped the website for ~20,000 movies. Further filtering (i.e. removing movies by major production companies) have resulted in a dataset of ~15,000 movies. To store all relevant movie details, I have used the following unofficial IMDb APIs (via RapidAPI):

  - [Movie Database (IMDB Alternative)](https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-imdb-alternative/1)
  - [Data-Imdb](https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/data-imdb1/)
  - [SERIES-MOVIES-IMDB](https://rapidapi.com/chrisish71/api/series-movies-imdb/)

To complement the data gathered via IMDb, I have used [TMDb's official API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to gather more details on keywords and gender of actors and directors.

The final dataset contains ~10,000 after removing missing content.
