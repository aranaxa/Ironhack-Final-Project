He is contacted by the renowned collector of books about the devil Boris Balkan, who has just acquired the rare The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows from the collector Andrew Telfer, to verify whether his book is authentic or a forgery. Balkan explains that the book was written by the writer Aristide Torchia, in 1666, with Lucifer and he was burned at the stake with his entire work. There are only three exemplars of The Nine Gates and in accordance with the legend, its nine engravings form a riddle to conjure the devil. The skeptical Corso accepts the assignment and has to fly to Sintra, Portugal, and Paris, France, to contact the owners Victor Fargas and Baroness Kessler and find the genuine exemplar for Balkan. Meanwhile, he asks Bernie to hide the rare book. Before traveling to Europe, the widow Liana Telfer wants to retrieve the book and has sex with Corso, but he does not accept her offer. When Corso returns to Bernie's bookstore, he finds his friend murdered in the same position of an engraving. Corso travels to Toledo, Spain, to meet the Ceniza twin brothers and learn more about The Nine Gates. During his journey in Europe, Corso is pursued by Liana and her bodyguard, who belong to the sect The Order of the Silver Serpents, and is protected by a mysterious Girl with supernatural powers. Meanwhile, the owners of the two other exemplars of The Nine Gates are murdered. Corso becomes obsessed with the book and discloses the truth about it. \u2014Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q1ZTFhMmYtNDljMS00Y2ZhLWE3M2QtMjYwYmFkYmJmMjI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NTI0Nw@@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR2,0,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "2,684", "movieReleasedAt": "1999-08-25", "movieFilmingLocation": "Ch\u00e2teau de Puivert, Aude, France", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0000136", "actorBirthName": "Johnny Depp"}, {"actorId": "nm0001449", "actorBirthName": "Frank Langella"}, {"actorId": "nm0000565", "actorBirthName": "Lena Olin"}], "movieGenres": ["Mystery", "Thriller"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0702416", "writerBirthName": "Arturo P\u00e9rez-Reverte"}, {"writerId": "nm0115224", "writerBirthName": "John Brownjohn"}, {"writerId": "nm0881762", "writerBirthName": "Enrique Urbizu"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "FR", "countryName": "France"}, {"countryCode": "ES", "countryName": "Spain"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0000591", "directorBirthName": "Roman Polanski"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}, {"languageCode": "fr", "languageName": "French"}, {"languageCode": "la", "languageName": "Latin"}, {"languageCode": "pt", "languageName": "Portuguese"}, {"languageCode": "es", "languageName": "Spanish"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0014903", "companyName": "Artisan Entertainment"}, {"companyId": "co0024473", "companyName": "R.P.

Although he does need to get to Hashimara soon, the plan to take the next train the following day the rest of the way, Ami is more concerned about where he will stay overnight. Although there is a small local hotel, he is offered a place to stay by and at the home of simpleminded Bimal Gupta, a local tea plantation owner who would like the company for the night seeing as to the isolation of the plantation and thus not seeing many people beyond his staff with who he does and cannot socialize. It isn't until Ami arrives with Bimal at his bungalow that he learns that Bimal's wife of three years is Karuna, his long lost love who he has not seen in several years, their previous relationship about which Bimal knows nothing. Ami and Karuna broke up largely because Ami would not make the commitment to marry especially as he knew her family did not approve of him being a poor student at the time. Ami has always been and is still in love with her - something he makes clear to her when they have a moment alone - and has been unable to move on romantically to any other woman since. Events of the evening and the next day until Ami needs to catch the train evoke memories for Ami of his previous time with Karuna. Ultimately, Ami would like them to reconcile as a couple. What happens is not only dependent upon if Karuna is in love with her husband, but also if she is still in love with Ami. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNjN2JlMWQtOGMyMi00NWY0LWE2YzctMzhlZjZhMjQ1MDY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgyNTA4MjM@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR4,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1994-04-13", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0154164", "actorBirthName": "Soumitra Chatterjee"}, {"actorId": "nm0611538", "actorBirthName": "Madhabi Mukherjee"}, {"actorId": "nm0052329", "actorBirthName": "Haradhan Bannerjee"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0593958", "writerBirthName": "Premendra Mitra"}, {"writerId": "nm0006249", "writerBirthName": "Satyajit Ray"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "IN", "countryName": "India"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0006249", "directorBirthName": "Satyajit Ray"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "bn", "languageName": "Bengali"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0034981", "companyName": "R.D.Banshal & Co."}], "movieTopCasting": {"Amitabha Roy": {"actorId": "nm0154164", "actorBirthName": "Soumitra Chatterjee"}, "Karuna Gupta": {"actorId": "nm0611538", "actorBirthName": "Madhabi Mukherjee"}, "Bimal Gupta": {"actorId": "nm0052329", "actorBirthName": "Haradhan Bannerjee"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0360845", "movieTitle": "Notre musique", "movieRating": "6.9/10", "movieRunTime": "1h 20min", "movieStoryLine": "\"Notre Music\" is divided in three kingdoms: Hell, Purgatory and Paradise like in the Dante's Inferno in the Divine Comedy.

In the spring of 1931 nine black hoboes were pulled off an Alabama freight train and arrested for allegedly raping two young white women in a gondola car. Ranging in ages from twelve to twenty years, they were quickly tried and sentenced to the electric chair. News of their convictions spread and the plight of the Scottsboro Boys became a 'cause celebre' that fueled the fire of socialism worldwide, forcing an appeal to the United States Supreme Court and resulting in new trials for all nine defendants. New Yorker Samuel Leibowitz, a savvy and self-assured defense lawyer with an impressive string of courtroom victories, agreed to represent the accused at their retrials in Decatur, Alabama. His journey into the Deep South symbolized the polarity of the times and set in motion a legal battle that ultimately changed the course of American jurisprudence. The Scottsboro case was a tragic chapter in American history and a story of epic injustice. From their arrest in 1931 to the release of the last Scottsboro defendant in 1950, the rights of nine young black men were violated. In this century in America, we face many of the same racial prejudices and human rights issues that existed almost seventy-five years ago. The names have changed, but the rhetoric that convicted the Scottsboro Nine remains virtually the same. Heavens Fall attempts to examine the cultural and political differences that divide us. It is my hope that by looking into the hearts and minds of the Scottsboro participants, black and white, North and South, powerful and impoverished, we may come to a better understanding of each other. \u2014Terry Green", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MDU3ODU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg2Mzk1MQ@@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR13,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2006-07-20", "movieFilmingLocation": "Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0000459", "actorBirthName": "Timothy Hutton"}, {"actorId": "nm0000657", "actorBirthName": "David Strathairn"}, {"actorId": "nm0005447", "actorBirthName": "Leelee Sobieski"}], "movieGenres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0338372", "writerBirthName": "Terry Green"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0338372", "directorBirthName": "Terry Green"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0093814", "companyName": "Strata Productions"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Samuel Leibowitz": {"actorId": "nm0000459", "actorBirthName": "Timothy Hutton"}, "Judge James Horton": {"actorId": "nm0000657", "actorBirthName": "David Strathairn"}, "Victoria Price": {"actorId": "nm0005447", "actorBirthName": "Leelee Sobieski"}, "William Lee": {"actorId": "nm1107001", "actorBirthName": "Anthony Mackie"}, "Thomas Knight, Jr.": {"actorId": "nm0756083", "actorBirthName": "Bill Sage"}, "Ruby Bates": {"actorId": "nm0005439", "actorBirthName": "Azura Skye"}, "Thomas Knight, Sr.": {"actorId": "nm0866055", "actorBirthName": "James Tolkan"}, "George Chamlee": {"actorId": "nm0810488", "actorBirthName": "Bill Smitrovich"}, "Lyle Harris": {"actorId": "nm0001999", "actorBirthName": "Maury Chaykin"}, "Joseph Brodsky": {"actorId": "nm0852668", "actorBirthName": "Joseph Lyle Taylor"}, "Haywood Patterson": {"actorId": "nm1580957", "actorBirthName": "B.J.

Meanwhile the Creep tells the tales of Creepshow: (1) \"Old Chief Wood'nhead\" - The elders Ray (George Kennedy) and Martha Spruce (Dorothy Lamour) have lived their whole life and raised their family with their small store in an Arizona town. Now the town is economically decadent and Ray gives credit to his customers; including the Indians of Ben Whitemoon's tribe. When Ray is repairing the wooden statue of an old chief in the front door, Ben (Frank Salsedo) arrives and asks him to keep the jewels of his tribe as a guarantee for their debts. However, Ben's nephew Sam (Holt McCallany) unexpectedly arrives with two other punks to steal Ray, and he kills the elders. They expect to travel to Hollywood, but the Old Chief Wood'nhead will not let them go. (2) \"The Raft\" - The teenagers Deke (Paul Satterfield) and Randy (Daniel Beer) travel with Laverne (Jeremy Green) and Rachel (Page Hannah) to a lake expecting to smoke weed, swim and get laid. They swim to a raft that is floating in the middle of the lake, but they discover a carnivorous blob in the lake that is hungry. (3) \"The Hitchhiker\" - In Maine, the unfaithful Annie Lansing (Lois Chiles) stays too long having sex with her escort and is late to meet her husband in the airport. She drives her Mercedes Benz in a hurry and loses control on the road. Annie runs over a hitchhiker, but she does not help the man and hit-and-run, questioning whether she can live with the situation. She discovers that the hitchhiker will not leave her. \u2014Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2QwZTMzODktNzRiYS00Y2JiLTk5ZmMtOGIwYTE1YTIyOTQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,17,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "4,846", "movieReleasedAt": "1987-12-16", "movieFilmingLocation": "12890 E Main St, Humboldt, Arizona, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0001421", "actorBirthName": "George Kennedy"}, {"actorId": "nm0001042", "actorBirthName": "Lois Chiles"}, {"actorId": "nm0424155", "actorBirthName": "Domenick John"}], "movieGenres": ["Fantasy", "Horror"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0000175", "writerBirthName": "Stephen King"}, {"writerId": "nm0001681", "writerBirthName": "George A.

He doesn't really want to be a criminal, but he doesn't share the dreams of his old friends from their working class neighborhood either. They all yearn for the culturally approved 9-to-5 Civil Service jobs with benefit packages that will carry them through weekends of beer into lazy retirement. Brian doesn't want to end up in a soul-numbing job like his buddies, but he's sure he doesn't want to be like his best friend Todd (Zachary Booth) either. Todd has betrayed their blue-collar roots by accepting a scholarship to college. But Brian has a secret -- he's a talented artist. In the basement of the bagel shop beneath his parent's apartment, he creates impressionistic charcoal and watercolor images of the stifling city that surrounds him. When he puts on his headphones and paints, shouting matches between Brian's longshoreman father Paddy (Stephen Lang) and world-weary mother (Karen Allen) fade into the distance. But even his private world can't block out the brutal beatings a drunken Paddy inflicts on Danny. Though Paddy has never been physically abusive to Brian, every time he sees his brother's suffering, his heart breaks a little more. Besides his art, Brian finds respite in working for Whitey (Peter Riegert), a kindly curmudgeon who runs the failing Lafayette movie theater in Bay Ridge. Brian's been helping Whitey pay his debts to local mobster Jimmy Cheeks (Ken Jennings) by bringing in rock groups to play gigs at the theater. With money problems mounting, Whitey decides to call in a lifelong favor from an old friend, now the tour manager of the Rolling Stones. The Stones will stop to play the Lafayette for one hour only on their way to Madison Square Garden...a plan Whitey hopes will solve his loan shark problems forever. The small Brooklyn neighborhood buzzes with anticipation of the Stones' arrival, which gives Brian the courage to talk to pretty Shauna Friel (Leslie Murphy), the girl he was too shy to approach in high school. Shauna, a travel agent, is awaiting transfer to a glamorous new job in Los Angeles, and dreams of traveling the world before she's 25. She and one of Brian's other friends, the college-bound Todd, begin to plant new seeds of hope in Brian's doubtful mind. Perhaps his art could be a ticket for him out of his dead end life and into a future of possibilities. When one excessively violent beating from Paddy convinces Danny he can't stay at home anymore, he tries to enlist Brian in one last scheme - to rob the Lafayette on the night of the Rolling Stones concert. Danny sees this as their only chance to get enough money to skip town and start them both off in a new life, somewhere far away from Brooklyn. As the theater fills with revelers, Brian is torn between his love and loyalty to Danny and his real fondness for Whitey. In the twists and turns that follow, both brothers must reexamine their dreams, and make decisions that will change their lives forever. \u2014Official site", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyODA3NDUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTgzNDA2NA@@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2011-03-25", "movieFilmingLocation": "Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm3231354", "actorBirthName": "Nick Thurston"}, {"actorId": "nm0927727", "actorBirthName": "Geoffrey Wigdor"}, {"actorId": "nm0002332", "actorBirthName": "Stephen Lang"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0336726", "writerBirthName": "John Gray"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0336726", "directorBirthName": "John Gray"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0290301", "companyName": "Annus Mirabilis Inc."}, {"companyId": "co0433833", "companyName": "Ovington Avenue Productions"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Brian": {"actorId": "nm3231354", "actorBirthName": "Nick Thurston"}, "Danny": {"actorId": "nm0927727", "actorBirthName": "Geoffrey Wigdor"}, "Patrick": {"actorId": "nm0002332", "actorBirthName": "Stephen Lang"}, "Margaret": {"actorId": "nm0000261", "actorBirthName": "Karen Allen"}, "Whitey": {"actorId": "nm0726200", "actorBirthName": "Peter Riegert"}, "Shauna": {"actorId": "nm2523816", "actorBirthName": "Leslie Murphy"}, "Todd": {"actorId": "nm2185539", "actorBirthName": "Zachary Booth"}, "Ray": {"actorId": "nm2814595", "actorBirthName": "Robbie Sublett"}, "Dennis": {"actorId": "nm1826988", "actorBirthName": "Michael Drayer"}, "Jerry": {"actorId": "nm3585980", "actorBirthName": "Henry Zebrowski"}, "Jimmy Cheeks": {"actorId": "nm0421194", "actorBirthName": "Ken Jennings"}, "Little Brian": {"actorId": "nm2175570", "actorBirthName": "Regan Mizrahi"}, "Little Danny": {"actorId": "nm3491752", "actorBirthName": "Anthony Amorim"}, "Cop": {"actorId": "nm0554241", "actorBirthName": "Jackie Martling"}, "Shorty": {"actorId": "nm0658861", "actorBirthName": "Jimmy Palumbo"}, "John car driver": {"actorId": "nm3667023", "actorBirthName": "John Farnworth"}, "Concertgoer": {"actorId": "nm3499092", "actorBirthName": "Kelli Flynn"}, "Diane": {"actorId": "nm3893980", "actorBirthName": "Lizzy Grant"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0087682", "movieTitle": "Maria's Lovers", "movieRating": "6.6/10", "movieRunTime": "1h 49min", "movieStoryLine": "Ivan Bibic returns to his Pittsburgh PA suburb after surviving a Japanse POW camp, causing regular nightmares.

Among the vessels sent is the nuclear sub, USS Alabama. But before they leave they need a new X.O. and among the choices is Commander Hunter, who hasn't seen much action. But the ship's Captain, Ramsey, OK's him. While on the way, there was an incident and Hunter disagreed with how Ramsey handled it. It's evident that Ramsey doesn't think much of Hunter because Hunter was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up. They're given orders to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order, the ship's communications were damaged, so the entire message was not received. Ramsey decides to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to reestablish contact first. That's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey. Later when some men die, some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to the task so they team up to retake control. But Hunter has taken precautions. \u2014rcs0411@yahoo.com", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmFkY2IxNTAtMWRiNS00MWU2LWI1NDYtY2YxYTQyYTk5OTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "2,946", "movieReleasedAt": "1995-09-06", "movieFilmingLocation": "Burbank City Hall - 275 E.

Abiding by their own, unique codes of honor and dividing the spoils equally, all is routine until the arrival of the mystifying, beautiful Ushna (Mylene Jampanoi). Appearing mysteriously after the raid of a pilgrim caravan, Ushna adheres to Jalan, claiming to have seen him in her dreams, and refusing to leave his side. Sensing the unease of the rest of the men, Ushna offers to help them in their endeavors, under condition that they not ask why or how she is able to guide them to success. In the time that follows, Ushna leads the gang to tremendous exploits, gaining the respect of the men, and the admiration of Jalan, who begins to fall passionately in love with this mysterious woman. As their success increases, seemingly unstoppable, so the love between Jalan and Ushna mounts in intensity, until they seem to have entered a world of their own. No longer heeding of the world around them, Jalan and Ushna venture too far in their exploits, progressing from the theft of material objects to tampering with elements that should never be tampered with; stealing energy, luck and even the powers of levitation, the two cross over into the bounds of the supernatural. Word of the duo and their strange exploits reaches the shrewd, robust Yeti (Naseeruddin Shah), who takes after them with his three experienced bounty hunters. In the confusion of pursuit, Jalan and Ushna face a temporary separation, the shock of which drives each to desperation. Having lost luck, wealth and friends, the fated two are nevertheless fortuitously reunited. Their passion running higher than ever, they vow never to be separated again, even if this entails deceiving fate and cheating mortality.

He is unceremoniously dumped by his whorish girlfriend Fiona on graduation day. Among the people he turns to in his hour of despair is his German pen pal, Mike. Scott and Mike seem to have a special connection. After Mike makes advances to Scott now that he and Fiona are not seeing each other, Scott abruptly sends Mike a message saying he never wants to hear from him again. However, Scott learns shorty thereafter that Mike is actually a beautiful girl named Mieke. By this time, Mieke has blocked his messages. Thinking that Mieke is actually who he was meant to be with, Scott, impulsively for a change, decides to go to Berlin to be with her. Along for the ride is Scott's best friend, the girl crazy Cooper Harris. They manage only to get a flight into London, and thus have to make their way from London to Berlin. Along the way in Paris, they run into their high school friends, twins Jenny and Jamie, who are backpacking through Europe. Scott and Cooper consider them the most mismatched twins ever, Jamie who is a walking encyclopedia, and Jenny a girl who they treat as just one of the guys. As the four try to make their way to Berlin, they run into a few obstacles and few adventures. Scott hopes that all these problems are worth it when he has his much hyped in his mind meeting with Mieke. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNjcxMDUxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjAxNTM3._V1_QL75_UY562_CR1,0,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "281", "movieReleasedAt": "2004-02-20", "movieFilmingLocation": "Milovice, Nymburk District, Czech Republic", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm1310709", "actorBirthName": "Scott Mechlowicz"}, {"actorId": "nm0686009", "actorBirthName": "Jacob Pitts"}, {"actorId": "nm0005502", "actorBirthName": "Michelle Trachtenberg"}], "movieGenres": ["Comedy"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0073688", "writerBirthName": "Alec Berg"}, {"writerId": "nm0541635", "writerBirthName": "David Mandel"}, {"writerId": "nm0769840", "writerBirthName": "Jeff Schaffer"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}, {"countryCode": "CZ", "countryName": "Czech Republic"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0769840", "directorBirthName": "Jeff Schaffer"}, {"directorId": "nm0073688", "directorBirthName": "Alec Berg"}, {"directorId": "nm0541635", "directorBirthName": "David Mandel"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}, {"languageCode": "fr", "languageName": "French"}, {"languageCode": "de", "languageName": "German"}, {"languageCode": "it", "languageName": "Italian"}, {"languageCode": "ja", "languageName": "Japanese"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0819670", "companyName": "Dreamworks Pictures"}, {"companyId": "co0118469", "companyName": "The Montecito Picture Company"}, {"companyId": "co0098163", "companyName": "Blue Sea Productions"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Scott Thomas": {"actorId": "nm1310709", "actorBirthName": "Scott Mechlowicz"}, "Cooper Harris": {"actorId": "nm0686009", "actorBirthName": "Jacob Pitts"}, "Jenny": {"actorId": "nm0005502", "actorBirthName": "Michelle Trachtenberg"}, "Jamie": {"actorId": "nm0922563", "actorBirthName": "Travis Wester"}, "Fiona": {"actorId": "nm0471036", "actorBirthName": "Kristin Kreuk"}, "Mrs. Thomas": {"actorId": "nm1537925", "actorBirthName": "Cathy Meils"}, "Bert": {"actorId": "nm1511518", "actorBirthName": "Nial Iskhakov"}, "Donny": {"actorId": "nm0000354", "actorBirthName": "Matt Damon"}, "Guitars - Lustra, Donny's Band": {"actorId": "nm1537779", "actorBirthName": "J.

The conflict between science and commercialism only increases when an enormous anthropoid is shot, and the horror only increases as the party realizes the other Yeti intend to retrieve their fallen comrade and have powers to do so which seem extra-human. \u2014Rich Wannen <RichWannen@worldnet.att.net>", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTE2N2Y1OWQtZDY5Ny00OTA1LWI2ZGEtOThkNWU1MGRiODFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEwMTA0NTc@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,7,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1958-09-24", "movieFilmingLocation": "Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, France", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0875861", "actorBirthName": "Forrest Tucker"}, {"actorId": "nm0001088", "actorBirthName": "Peter Cushing"}, {"actorId": "nm0175015", "actorBirthName": "Maureen Connell"}], "movieGenres": ["Adventure", "Horror"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0460600", "writerBirthName": "Nigel Kneale"}, {"writerId": "nm0346436", "writerBirthName": "Val Guest"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "GB", "countryName": "United Kingdom"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0346436", "directorBirthName": "Val Guest"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0130933", "companyName": "Clarion Films"}, {"companyId": "co0060069", "companyName": "Hammer Films"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Tom Friend": {"actorId": "nm0875861", "actorBirthName": "Forrest Tucker"}, "Dr. Rollason": {"actorId": "nm0001088", "actorBirthName": "Peter Cushing"}, "Helen Rollason": {"actorId": "nm0175015", "actorBirthName": "Maureen Connell"}, "Peter Fox": {"actorId": "nm0915077", "actorBirthName": "Richard Wattis"}, "Ed.

When Mac McDonald loses his son in an accident, the ensuing 17 years of bitterness and pain erode his love for his family and leave him angry with God - and just about everyone else. Mac's rage stonewalls his career in the police department and creates a combustible situation when he's partnered with Sam Wright, a rising star on the force who happens to be a part-time pastor and a loving family man. Can they somehow join forces to help each other when it's impossible for either of them to look past their differences--especially the most obvious one? Every day, we have the opportunity to rebuild relationships and heal deep wounds by extending and receiving God's grace.

In an attempt to avoid to be attacked, Gedeone tells him a story about a king bear named Leonce who, playing in a river with his son Tonio, losses the prince when he's kidnapped by humans and taken far away from the forest. Neglecting his liabilities as king to care his clan during several months due by the affliction of the loss, finally he's concerned by his second hand Salpetre about the possibility that Tonio could be alive in the land of men. Leonce calls his clan to move there, but the evil Grand Duc is reported by old magician Theophile about bears' invasion and he sends Theophile to defeat them, failing in an attempts that include a wild boars horde, a ghost castle and an ogre bear eater. Full of anger, Grand Duc sends his army against bear clan, in a great battle where Grand Duc thinks bears are defeated. Appearing on the city, Leonce finally locates Tonio, who is shot by Grand Duc. Saved by Theophile, Leonce defeats Grand Duc and claims as king of Sicile, joining bears and humans as only one race \"and they lived happily ever after\".

Joe was from Santa Barbara, California, where Francine and the extended Holden family still live. Arvilla is certain that Joe wrote a new will after they got married, but since that will is nowhere to be found, the official will is the one that Francine has in her possession, which outlines certain things that Arvilla knows Joe would not now have wanted. That will states that Joe's embalmed body is to be interned with Francine's mother in Santa Barbara, despite Joe already having been cremated. Arvilla knows that Joe would have wanted his ashes scattered into the wind. The will also deeds the house in which Arvilla and Joe lived their entire marriage to Francine, which would leave Arvilla not only homeless, but shut out of the house in which she has strong and loving memories. Francine offers a settlement with Arvilla: Joe's ashes for the house. Arvilla reluctantly agrees. Arvilla plans on bringing the ashes to the memorial service in Santa Barbara in one week's time, accompanied by her two best friends, free wheeling and single Margene Cunningham, and \"perfect\" mom Carol Brimm, all three women being Mormon of varying devotion. The plan is to drive the three hours from Pocatello to Salt Lake City, Utah, to catch a flight to Santa Barbara. But upon their departure from Pocatello in Joe's refurbished Pontiac Bonneville convertible, Arvilla takes the three on a road trip instead to all the places she and Joe loved en route to Santa Barbara. This trip gives Arvilla time to decide ultimately what she will do regarding her deal with Francine, which is affected by her time with Margene and Carol, and by encounters they have with people they meet along the way, most specifically a young man named Bo who is on a search for his biological father who he has never met, and a long haul trucker named Emmett. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4NDM0NDk5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyMzU1MQ@@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,1,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2008-02-29", "movieFilmingLocation": "Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0001448", "actorBirthName": "Jessica Lange"}, {"actorId": "nm0000870", "actorBirthName": "Kathy Bates"}, {"actorId": "nm0000260", "actorBirthName": "Joan Allen"}], "movieGenres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm2080217", "writerBirthName": "Daniel D.

What they are all unaware of is that she is really Carmen, the daughter of the once great matador, Antonio Villalta. On the day Carmen was born, her father suffered a career ending accident, and her mother died in childbirth. Her father quickly remarried his nurse, the evil Encarna. Although raised by her grandmother during her early years, Carmen, following the death of her grandmother, went to live with Encarna while an adolescent, Encarna who treated her as a slave. Carmen eventually found her disabled father, who was hidden away and treated poorly by Encarna. In the meantime, Encarna was cavorting with the household chauffeur while living off her husband's riches. Antonio did pass along to Carmen the art of bullfighting.

Alice's mother blames her husband for their low social standing, despite his working hard and Alice not blaming him for anything. Regardless, Alice tries to do whatever necessary to put on appearances of wealth and social standing, despite everyone in that class in town knowing who she is, and thus largely ignoring her because of her false airs. First meeting at a society ball, Alice surprisingly catches the eye of Arthur Russell, surprisingly as he purportedly is engaged to d\u00e9butante Mildred Palmer. As Alice continues to hide her true social standing from Arthur as he courts her, Mrs. Adams pressures Mr. Adams into doing something he doesn't want to do in an effort truly to become part of the business class, that measure which entails sinking all his money into a business venture. Beyond the time when Arthur finds out the true nature behind Alice's facade, other issues may bring the fragile Adams society house of cards tumbling down around them, and thus the happiness Alice is seeking with Arthur. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJkYmJmOTMtMjJmZi00OGE4LTgwNzYtY2Q4MzU1NjYxN2M0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0MzMzNjA@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,93,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1935-11-29", "movieFilmingLocation": "RKO Studios - 780 N.

However--as the bright rural student pursues a denied education and an opportunity, desirous of integrating herself into the modern Swedish society--a painful visit by a team of anthropologists paired by a traumatic experience will be the harsh reminders of an ever-present brutal prejudice and a deep-seated racism.

Helen uses the word \"sensitive\" to describe Carol's overall demeanor, which is almost like she walks around in a daze, rarely speaking up about anything. When she does speak up, it generally is about something against one of those few issues on which she obsesses, such as Helen's boyfriend Michael's invasion of her space at the apartment. That specific issue may be more about men in general than just Michael's actions, as witnessed by Carol being agitated by hearing Helen and Michael's lovemaking, and she not being able to rebuff the advances effectively of a male suitor, Colin, who is infatuated with her. One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them. While Helen and Michael leave on a vacation to Pisa, Italy, Carol chooses largely to lock herself in the apartment, ditching work. There, she is almost hypnotized by her solitude, which leads to her mental state deteriorating as those obsessions come to the fore. She quickly descends into madness, which ultimately also affects those that are trying to get in touch with her. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTU5ZThjNzAtNjc4NC00OTViLWIxYTYtODFmMTk5Y2NjZjZiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,3,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1966-01-07", "movieFilmingLocation": "Thurloe Place, South Kensington, London, England, UK", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0000366", "actorBirthName": "Catherine Deneuve"}, {"actorId": "nm0376915", "actorBirthName": "Ian Hendry"}, {"actorId": "nm0292159", "actorBirthName": "John Fraser"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama", "Horror", "Thriller"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0000591", "writerBirthName": "Roman Polanski"}, {"writerId": "nm0102722", "writerBirthName": "G\u00e9rard Brach"}, {"writerId": "nm0831816", "writerBirthName": "David Stone"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "GB", "countryName": "United Kingdom"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0000591", "directorBirthName": "Roman Polanski"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0103330", "companyName": "Compton Films"}, {"companyId": "co0137938", "companyName": "Tekli British Productions"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Carol": {"actorId": "nm0000366", "actorBirthName": "Catherine Deneuve"}, "Michael": {"actorId": "nm0376915", "actorBirthName": "Ian Hendry"}, "Colin": {"actorId": "nm0292159", "actorBirthName": "John Fraser"}, "Helen": {"actorId": "nm0299014", "actorBirthName": "Yvonne Furneaux"}, "Landlord": {"actorId": "nm0943859", "actorBirthName": "Patrick Wymark"}, "Miss Balch": {"actorId": "nm0396881", "actorBirthName": "Renee Houston"}, "Madame Denise": {"actorId": "nm0853293", "actorBirthName": "Valerie Taylor"}, "John": {"actorId": "nm0898376", "actorBirthName": "James Villiers"}, "Bridget": {"actorId": "nm0292136", "actorBirthName": "Helen Fraser"}, "Reggie": {"actorId": "nm0299412", "actorBirthName": "Hugh Futcher"}, "Mrs. Rendlesham": {"actorId": "nm0581011", "actorBirthName": "Monica Merlin"}, "Manicurist": {"actorId": "nm0334081", "actorBirthName": "Imogen Graham"}, "Workman": {"actorId": "nm0695511", "actorBirthName": "Mike Pratt"}, "Neighbour": {"actorId": "nm3641068", "actorBirthName": "Joe Beckett"}, "Neighbor": {"actorId": "nm0021125", "actorBirthName": "Tony Allen"}, "Passer-by on South Kensington Street": {"actorId": "nm0069275", "actorBirthName": "Hercules Bellville"}, "Old Man": {"actorId": "nm0097848", "actorBirthName": "Wallace Bosco"}}}, {"movieId": "tt2387627", "movieTitle": "Zinda Bhaag", "movieRating": "7.6/10", "movieRunTime": "1h 55min", "movieStoryLine": "What makes a man step into a cargo container that is going to be sealed for days? Why does he step into a flimsy overloaded boat to face a stormy sea? Or dart across international borders dodging bullets? What are the compulsions faced by men in Pakistan, which make them take extreme risks to chase a mirage of a secure future in alien lands? Set against the backdrop of the world of illegal immigration, Zinda Bhaag is a film about three young men trying to escape the reality of their everyday lives ... and succeeding in ways they had least expected. In a nondescript neighbourhood of Lahore, three friends are desperate to get on to the fast track to success. Khaldi, Taambi and Chitta, all in their early twenties, believe that the only way out ... is to the West. The journey that unfolds through the story of this film gives us a peep into what constitutes the everyday in the lives of many young men and women in Pakistan - a sense of entitlement that cannot be fulfilled, desperation to somehow prove themselves in the face of all legitimate doors being locked and an ennui from which they feel there is no getaway. \u2014Farjad Nabi & Meenu Kaur",

German-Jew Max Rothman has returned to much of his pre-war life which includes to his wife Nina and their two children, to his mistress Liselore von Peltz, and to his work as an art dealer. He has however not returned to being an aspiring painter as he lost his dominant right arm during the war. He is approached by an aspiring painter, a thirty-year old Austrian war veteran named Adolf Hitler, who wants him to show his works. Although he doesn't think the paintings are all that original and he doesn't really like Hitler as a person, Rothman takes Hitler under his wings if only because of their camaraderie of being war veterans, and knowing that Hitler had nothing and no one to come back to after the war unlike himself. Rothman believes that Hitler has promise if only he can find his original artistic point of view. In part out of need for money, Hitler, on the urging of Captain Karl Mayr, agrees to work for the army as a political spokesman in anti-Semitic propaganda. Slowly, Hitler's view becomes a holistic one of a new world, where he begins to meld his art and politics. Rothman becomes excited about Hitler's artistic viewpoint, despite its anti-Semitic bent. The question becomes if the sentiments behind the view will take over its artistic merit. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2OTQzMTU1ODFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDQ3NzY5OQ@@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR9,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2003-09-17", "movieFilmingLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0000131", "actorBirthName": "John Cusack"}, {"actorId": "nm0852965", "actorBirthName": "Noah Taylor"}, {"actorId": "nm0005447", "actorBirthName": "Leelee Sobieski"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama", "War"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0583675", "writerBirthName": "Menno Meyjes"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "HU", "countryName": "Hungary"}, {"countryCode": "CA", "countryName": "Canada"}, {"countryCode": "GB", "countryName": "United Kingdom"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0583675", "directorBirthName": "Menno Meyjes"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0108358", "companyName": "AAMPI Inc."}, {"companyId": "co0084152", "companyName": "Aconit Pictures"}, {"companyId": "co0054762", "companyName": "Alliance Atlantis Communications"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Max Rothman": {"actorId": "nm0000131", "actorBirthName": "John Cusack"}, "Adolf Hitler": {"actorId": "nm0852965", "actorBirthName": "Noah Taylor"}, "Liselore von Peltz": {"actorId": "nm0005447", "actorBirthName": "Leelee Sobieski"}, "Nina Rothman": {"actorId": "nm0662504", "actorBirthName": "Molly Parker"}, "Captain Mayr": {"actorId": "nm0860947", "actorBirthName": "Ulrich Thomsen"}, "Max's Father": {"actorId": "nm0395257", "actorBirthName": "David Horovitch"}, "Max's Mother": {"actorId": "nm0840531", "actorBirthName": "Janet Suzman"}, "NCO": {"actorId": "nm0831127", "actorBirthName": "Andr\u00e1s Stohl"}, "Nina's Father": {"actorId": "nm0342038", "actorBirthName": "John Grillo"}, "Nina's Mother": {"actorId": "nm0638633", "actorBirthName": "Anna Nygh"}, "Nina's Brother": {"actorId": "nm1069559", "actorBirthName": "Kriszti\u00e1n Kolovratnik"}, "David Cohn": {"actorId": "nm0134922", "actorBirthName": "Peter Capaldi"}, "Hildegard": {"actorId": "nm0904574", "actorBirthName": "Yuliya Vysotskaya"}, "Mr. Epp": {"actorId": "nm0474603", "actorBirthName": "J\u00e1nos Kulka"}, "Mrs. Epp": {"actorId": "nm0701647", "actorBirthName": "Kata P\u00e1lfi"}, "George Grosz": {"actorId": "nm0571727", "actorBirthName": "Kevin McKidd"}, "Ada Rothman": {"actorId": "nm1247393", "actorBirthName": "Heather Cameron-McLintock"}, "Paul Rothman": {"actorId": "nm0686012", "actorBirthName": "Joel Pitts"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0418887", "movieTitle": "Mi nismo andjeli 2", "movieRating": "6.1/10", "movieTrailer": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1650835737", "movieRunTime": "1h 29min", "movieStoryLine": "In this sequel of \"We Are Not Angels\", a highly successful Yugoslavian comedy, a former playboy must cope with his daughter's adolescence, as well as numerous boys that keep knocking at her doors.

Bella's delicate constitution takes a turn for the worse after moving into the house, she forgetting and misplacing things, as well as being delusional in hearing noises in the closed off upper floors of the house, and seeing the lights flicker when no one else is in the house, those flickers which should only occur when other lights are turned on and off in the house in the gas to the lights being dispersed. Paul's love for her crosses that fine line into hate in dealing with Bella's worsening mental health, he isolating her in the house in not wanting to be embarrassed by her in public. Paul's harsh treatment exacerbates the situation as Bella teeters on the brink of madness. However, B.G. Rough, the livery stable owner who was once a police constable who worked on the Barlow case, believes Paul Mallen not the person he says he is and is really someone indirectly associated to the Barlow case. With the help of Bella's cousin Vincent Ullswater, who has always been at odds with Paul, who in turn has refused to let him see Bella without her knowledge, Rough may uncover what is happening behind the locked doors of 12 Pimlico Square. Rough discovering the truth may or may not be too late for Bella's sanity and thus her life. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIxYWY0ZGEtNmRiZS00ZTdhLThiZmMtMDA4YTE4ZTY2ODJmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTYxNjkxOQ@@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,4,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1940-08-31", "movieFilmingLocation": "D&P Studios, Denham Studios, Denham, Buckinghamshire, England, UK", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0906932", "actorBirthName": "Anton Walbrook"}, {"actorId": "nm0944087", "actorBirthName": "Diana Wynyard"}, {"actorId": "nm0678693", "actorBirthName": "Frank Pettingell"}], "movieGenres": ["Mystery", "Thriller"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0358096", "writerBirthName": "Patrick Hamilton"}, {"writerId": "nm0712653", "writerBirthName": "A.R.

This film recounts the incident from the perspectives of three very different characters. Lien is a Vietnamese woman who settled in Germany, but at the end of the day she will be fighting for her life wondering if the place she called home could ever be one for her. Stefan and his friends are part of the night's violent turmoil. Young and angry, bored during the daytime, they look forward to the nightly riots and clashes with the police and foreigners. Unable to cope with his grief at the loss of a friend, Stefan gets lost in a circle of violence. Stefan's father Martin is an ambitious local politician, trapped in a dilemma: does he advance his career or stand up for his ideals and take responsibility, which includes that for his son? \u2014German Films Service + Marketing", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MzUzNTAyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE3NzA4NjE@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR21,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2015-01-22", "movieFilmingLocation": "Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm1909076", "actorBirthName": "Jonas Nay"}, {"actorId": "nm6233165", "actorBirthName": "Trang Le Hong"}, {"actorId": "nm0834479", "actorBirthName": "Devid Striesow"}], "movieGenres": ["Crime", "Drama", "History"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm2935195", "writerBirthName": "Martin Behnke"}, {"writerId": "nm2546059", "writerBirthName": "Burhan Qurbani"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "DE", "countryName": "Germany"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm2546059", "directorBirthName": "Burhan Qurbani"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "de", "languageName": "German"}, {"languageCode": "vi", "languageName": "Vietnamese"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0010760", "companyName": "UFA Fiction"}, {"companyId": "co0222794", "companyName": "Das Kleine Fernsehspiel (ZDF)"}, {"companyId": "co0014456", "companyName": "ARTE"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Stefan": {"actorId": "nm1909076", "actorBirthName": "Jonas Nay"}, "Lien": {"actorId": "nm6233165", "actorBirthName": "Trang Le Hong"}, "Martin": {"actorId": "nm0834479", "actorBirthName": "Devid Striesow"}, "Robbie": {"actorId": "nm2056274", "actorBirthName": "Joel Basman"}, "Jennie": {"actorId": "nm4551978", "actorBirthName": "Saskia Rosendahl"}, "Goldhahn": {"actorId": "nm1879559", "actorBirthName": "Paul G\u00e4bler"}, "Sandro": {"actorId": "nm4198580", "actorBirthName": "David Sch\u00fctter"}, "Tabor": {"actorId": "nm2245251", "actorBirthName": "Jakob Bieber"}, "Ramona": {"actorId": "nm3893807", "actorBirthName": "Gro Swantje Kohlhof"}, "Thao": {"actorId": "nm6153649", "actorBirthName": "Mai Duong Kieu"}, "Minh": {"actorId": "nm1350980", "actorBirthName": "Aaron Le"}, "Kathrin": {"actorId": "nm5075851", "actorBirthName": "Larissa Fuchs"}, "J\u00fcrgen": {"actorId": "nm0660386", "actorBirthName": "Axel Pape"}, "Peter": {"actorId": "nm0581536", "actorBirthName": "Thorsten Merten"}, "Philipp": {"actorId": "nm2852870", "actorBirthName": "Enno Trebs"}, "W\u00e4schereichef": {"actorId": "nm0107495", "actorBirthName": "Matthias Brenner"}, "Katrins Tochter": {"actorId": "nm7616615", "actorBirthName": "Fiona Zerrenner"}, "Polizeieinsatzleiter": {"actorId": "nm1327702", "actorBirthName": "Sebastian Nakajew"}}}, {"movieId": "tt1695831", "movieTitle": "Eldfjall", "movieRating": "7.2/10", "movieRunTime": "1h 39min", "movieStoryLine": "At the beginning of the film Hannes is experiencing the pain of his last day at work, aged 67 and after 37 years as a school caretaker and before that as a fisherman living in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. The 1973 volcanic eruption of Eldfell forced him to move the family to the mainland. Retirement does not come easy and it's clear that for some time Hannes has become estranged from his wife and family. On a topical note, his daughter Telma has just been promoted as a loans manager in a bank - to the disgust of her father. His son Ari is divorced, but usually has his small son in tow. Most long-suffering is Anna, the matriarch of the family. Who's really loved by her husband, but when her children are around she has to suffer his intolerance and volatile moods. After nearly sinking in his old fishing boat, Hannes begins to soften and he and Anna have a rapprochement - which is almost immediately halted by tragedy when Anna has a very severe stroke.What follows is a deeply moving study of how Hannes comes to terms with what life has given him: to take care of wife at home instead of in a nursing home. The 'volcano' is actually Hannes himself, a seemingly cold and gray man with his emotions in tumult within about to erupt. \u2014bobbuckingham", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTUwNDU2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5OTE1NQ@@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,1,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2011-09-30", "movieFilmingLocation": "Iceland", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm4426267", "actorBirthName": "Au\u00f0ur Drauma Bachmann"}, {"actorId": "nm0045489", "actorBirthName": "\u00deorsteinn Bachmann"}, {"actorId": "nm2630943", "actorBirthName": "Krist\u00edn Dav\u00ed\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm1242172", "writerBirthName": "R\u00fanar R\u00fanarsson"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "IS", "countryName": "Iceland"}, {"countryCode": "DK", "countryName": "Denmark"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm1242172", "directorBirthName": "R\u00fanar R\u00fanarsson"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "is", "languageName": "Icelandic"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0090400", "companyName": "Fine & Mellow Productions"}, {"companyId": "co0323717", "companyName": "Zik Zak Filmworks"}, {"companyId": "co0046271", "companyName": "Zik Zak Kvikmyndir"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Tinna": {"actorId": "nm4426267", "actorBirthName": "Au\u00f0ur Drauma Bachmann"}, "Ari": {"actorId": "nm0045489", "actorBirthName": "\u00deorsteinn Bachmann"}, "Nurse": {"actorId": "nm2630943", "actorBirthName": "Krist\u00edn Dav\u00ed\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir"}, "P\u00e1lmi": {"actorId": "nm0259574", "actorBirthName": "Benedikt Erlingsson"}, "Telma": {"actorId": "nm1375232", "actorBirthName": "Elma L\u00edsa Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir"}, "Janitor": {"actorId": "nm0348276", "actorBirthName": "\u00der\u00f6stur Le\u00f3 Gunnarsson"}, "Principal": {"actorId": "nm0361793", "actorBirthName": "Harald G.

She is preparing to move her family out of the field they live in as plowing time approaches, however her son Timothy has fallen ill, and moving him could prove fatal. Mrs. Brisby visits The Great Owl, a wise creature who advises her to visit a mysterious group of rats who live beneath a rose bush on the farm. Upon visiting the rats, Brisby meets Nicodemus, the wise and mystical leader of the rats, and Justin, a friendly rat who immediately becomes attached to Mrs. Brisby. While there, she learns that her late husband, Mr. Jonathon Brisby, along with the rats, was a part of a series of experiments at a place known only as N.I.M.H. (revealed earlier in the story as the National Institute of Mental Health). The experiments performed on the mice and rats there boosted their intelligence, allowing them to read without being taught and to understand things such as complex mechanics and electricity. The rats and Mr. Brisby escaped from N.I.M.H. and came to live on the Fitzgibbon farm. The rats created a home for themselves under Mrs. Fitzgibbon's rose bush, creating an elaborate habitation of beautiful chambers, elevators, and Christmas lights. However, the rats are unhappy in their dependence on the humans, who they are stealing electricity from, and have concocted a plan to leave the farm and live independently. Because of her husband's prior relationship with the rats, they agree to help Mrs. Brisby move her home out of the path of the plow.

This tragic flaw leads him to risk all that he loves and values, his beloved family, indeed even his immortal soul and salvation, in blind pursuit of that goal. \u2014Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu>", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGE1YWZjMWUtMzYzMC00NjdkLWI3NDgtZjdiYTZkMDc0YTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTczNjQwOTY@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR5,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1993-10-06", "movieFilmingLocation": "Middleton, Greater Manchester, England, UK", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0427646", "actorBirthName": "Bruce Jones"}, {"actorId": "nm0113936", "actorBirthName": "Julie Brown"}, {"actorId": "nm0681085", "actorBirthName": "Gemma Phoenix"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama", "Comedy"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0020653", "writerBirthName": "Jim Allen"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "GB", "countryName": "United Kingdom"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0516360", "directorBirthName": "Ken Loach"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0103532", "companyName": "Channel Four Films"}, {"companyId": "co0103670", "companyName": "Parallax Pictures"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Bob": {"actorId": "nm0427646", "actorBirthName": "Bruce Jones"}, "Anne": {"actorId": "nm0113936", "actorBirthName": "Julie Brown"}, "Coleen": {"actorId": "nm0681085", "actorBirthName": "Gemma Phoenix"}, "Tommy": {"actorId": "nm0866870", "actorBirthName": "Ricky Tomlinson"}, "Father Barry": {"actorId": "nm0382675", "actorBirthName": "Tom Hickey"}, "Jimmy": {"actorId": "nm0266432", "actorBirthName": "Mike Fallon"}, "Butcher": {"actorId": "nm0712426", "actorBirthName": "Ronnie Ravey"}, "Irishman": {"actorId": "nm5510352", "actorBirthName": "Lee Brennan"}, "Young Mother": {"actorId": "nm0378269", "actorBirthName": "Karen Henthorn"}, "May": {"actorId": "nm0007949", "actorBirthName": "Christine Abbott"}, "Tracey": {"actorId": "nm0911561", "actorBirthName": "Geraldine Ward"}, "Joe": {"actorId": "nm0038673", "actorBirthName": "William Ash"}, "Sean": {"actorId": "nm0167303", "actorBirthName": "Matthew Clucas"}, "Shop Assistant": {"actorId": "nm0419202", "actorBirthName": "Anna Jaskolka"}, "Tansey": {"actorId": "nm0416640", "actorBirthName": "Jonathan James"}, "Ted": {"actorId": "nm0090850", "actorBirthName": "Anthony Bodell"}, "Ted's Mate": {"actorId": "nm0611936", "actorBirthName": "Bob Mullane"}, "Mike": {"actorId": "nm0550440", "actorBirthName": "Jack Marsden"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0085900", "movieTitle": "Le Marginal", "movieRating": "6.4/10", "movieTrailer": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3679239705", "movieRunTime": "1h 43min", "movieStoryLine": "Fed-up with the inefficiency of the Marseille police, Paris sends drug-enforcement specialist Philippe Jordan to Marseille.

Men were subject to harsh labor and kept from traditional hunting; whereas women had to serve the Japanese policemen and their families by doing the household work and giving up their traditional weaving work. Above all, they were forbidden to tattoo their faces. And these tattoos were seen as the Seediq's traditional belief to transform themselves into Seediq Bale (\"true humans\"). Mona Rudao, the protagonist, witnessed the repression by the Japanese over a period of 30 years. Sometime between autumn and winter 1930, when the slave labor is at its harshest, a young Seediq couple are married and a joyful party is thrown. At the same time, a newly appointed Japanese policeman goes on his inspection tour to this tribe. Mona Rudao's first son, Tado Mona, offers wine to the policeman with gusto, but is in return beaten up because his hands were considered not clean enough. With anger, Tado Mona and his brother Baso Mona attack the policeman. And from that day onward, their tribe is living in the shadow of being the object of revenge by the Japanese. In a few days, a group of youth surround Mona Rudao. They strongly request him to lead the retaliation against the Japanese. Mona Rudao struggles for a long time between extending his fellow's lives and fighting back for dignity, until he sees these youngster's faces - clear without Seediq's tattoos - that he made up his mind. He tells the youngsters, \"Japanese troops out-number the stones in Dakusui River, more intensive than the leaves in the forest, but my determination fighting them is ever stronger than Mt. Kire.\" \"Children! On the tip of the Rainbow Bridge led to home of our ancestor's spirits, there is another beautiful hunting range. Our ancestors are all there! Remember, only brave spirits can enter this place, and we can never lose it. My fellows, let us hunt the heads of our enemies, and we wash our spirits with blood so that we walk the Rainbow Bridge to be always with our ancestors.\" The film Seediq Bale depicts the Wushe Incident, which occurred in central Taiwan during the Japanese rule. When the Seediq Bale, believing in the Rainbow, and the Japanese, believing in the Sun, met one another, they fought. The leader of Seediq Bale, Mona Rudao, led 300 warriors fighting against 3000 Japanese troopers. The only thing they forgot was whether it was the Rainbow or the Sun they believed in; they actually believed in the same sky. \u2014Anonymous", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQ0NGI5YzEtMGUwYy00ZDUzLTk3ZTItNWRmYWJlNzRhM2RiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzEyMjM4Mjc@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR6,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2011-09-09", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0027942", "actorBirthName": "Masanobu And\u00f4"}, {"actorId": "nm0367389", "actorBirthName": "Jun'ichi Haruta"}, {"actorId": "nm0442754", "actorBirthName": "Sabu Kawahara"}], "movieGenres": ["Action", "Drama", "History"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0917669", "writerBirthName": "Te-Sheng Wei"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "TW", "countryName": "Taiwan"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0917669", "directorBirthName": "Te-Sheng Wei"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "qac", "languageName": "Aboriginal"}, {"languageCode": "ja", "languageName": "Japanese"}, {"languageCode": "qab", "languageName": "Hokkien"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0243253", "companyName": "ARS Film Production"}, {"companyId": "co0057606", "companyName": "Central Motion Pictures"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Genji Kojima, Constable at Tonbara clan": {"actorId": "nm0027942", "actorBirthName": "Masanobu And\u00f4"}, "Egawa Hiromichi, Police chief in Wushe area": {"actorId": "nm0367389", "actorBirthName": "Jun'ichi Haruta"}, "General Yahiko Kamada": {"actorId": "nm0442754", "actorBirthName": "Sabu Kawahara"}, "Li, Ching-Fang, Special envoy of China": {"actorId": "nm0849294", "actorBirthName": "Shiang-Chu Tang"}, "Mona Rudao": {"actorId": "nm4595384", "actorBirthName": "Nolay Piho"}, "Temu Walis": {"actorId": "nm2208579", "actorBirthName": "Chih-Hsiang Ma"}, "Obing Tadao aka Hatsuko Takayama": {"actorId": "nm0398852", "actorBirthName": "Vivian Hsu"}, "Obing Nawi aka Hanako Kawano": {"actorId": "nm4629744", "actorBirthName": "Mei-Ling Lo"}, "Mahung Mona (Mona's Daughter)": {"actorId": "nm2639075", "actorBirthName": "Landy Wen"}, "Mona Rudao - Young": {"actorId": "nm4595701", "actorBirthName": "Da-Ching"}, "Chief Rudao Luhe, Mona's Father": {"actorId": "nm6071443", "actorBirthName": "Pawan Nawi"}, "Tado Mona (Mona's Eldest Son)": {"actorId": "nm5555540", "actorBirthName": "Yakau Kuhon"}, "Baso Mona (Mona's Younger Son)": {"actorId": "nm5555725", "actorBirthName": "Pawan Neyung"}, "Pawan Nawi": {"actorId": "nm5556203", "actorBirthName": "Yuan-Jie Lin"}, "Biho Sapo": {"actorId": "nm3117467", "actorBirthName": "Chih-Wei Cheng"}, "Ichiro Hanaoka aka Dakis Nomin": {"actorId": "nm4689774", "actorBirthName": "Yi-Fan Hsu"}, "Jiro Hanaoka aka Dakis Nawi": {"actorId": "nm4690048", "actorBirthName": "Soda Voyu"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0838231", "movieTitle": "Unfinished Sky", "movieRating": "6.8/10", "movieRunTime": "1h 34min", "movieStoryLine": "Honest Australian Outback sheep-farmer John Woldring leads an isolated life.

Ian a non-conformist teacher who is also blind is hired at the school and introduces revolutionary methods: Rejecting the use of a cane, Ian teaches the children to achieve spatial orientation by using all of their senses including moving by the resonance of sound vibrations (echolocation), instinct, and the creative use of their imagination. Confident and even slightly over-aggressive, Ian charms the children and gives them a reason to hope, though they are always testing and questioning him to prove that he is one of them and never seem quite convinced of his sincerity. Ian's sessions take place right under the window of Eva (Alexandra Maria Lara), an adult patient who never leaves her room and does not speak to anybody. Surprisingly, she becomes one of his most responsive students and there is even a hint of romance. The two bond as they begin to trust each other. Together they visit a caf\u00e9 (where she flirts with a young man), walk along the harbor and cross busy streets without any aids other than their ability to listen for the sounds of vehicles, footsteps, or other obstacles in their path. They are followed by Serrano, a young blind boy whom Ian asks to use his imagination to \"see\" a ship in the harbor. The new teacher is challenged by the school doctor and head teacher of the school (Francis Frappat) who is concerned that he is giving the children the illusion of hope... \u2014Good Edward", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMjMyMDkwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0NjAyOQ@@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR21,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2013-10-23", "movieFilmingLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm1296102", "actorBirthName": "Edward Hogg"}, {"actorId": "nm0487884", "actorBirthName": "Alexandra Maria Lara"}, {"actorId": "nm0078696", "actorBirthName": "Melchior Derouet"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm1435889", "writerBirthName": "Andrzej Jakimowski"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "PL", "countryName": "Poland"}, {"countryCode": "PT", "countryName": "Portugal"}, {"countryCode": "FR", "countryName": "France"}, {"countryCode": "GB", "countryName": "United Kingdom"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm1435889", "directorBirthName": "Andrzej Jakimowski"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}, {"languageCode": "fr", "languageName": "French"}, {"languageCode": "pt", "languageName": "Portuguese"}, {"languageCode": "de", "languageName": "German"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0109608", "companyName": "Zjednoczenie Artyst\u00f3w i Rzemieslnik\u00f3w"}, {"companyId": "co0198435", "companyName": "KMBO"}, {"companyId": "co0024285", "companyName": "Film and Music Entertainment (F&ME)"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Ian": {"actorId": "nm1296102", "actorBirthName": "Edward Hogg"}, "Eva": {"actorId": "nm0487884", "actorBirthName": "Alexandra Maria Lara"}, "Serrano": {"actorId": "nm0078696", "actorBirthName": "Melchior Derouet"}, "Doctor": {"actorId": "nm0292015", "actorBirthName": "Francis Frappat"}, "Brother Humberto": {"actorId": "nm0481155", "actorBirthName": "Jo\u00e3o Lagarto"}, "Ian's Student": {"actorId": "nm5886809", "actorBirthName": "Sofia Santos"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0069818", "movieTitle": "Le boss", "movieRating": "7.0/10", "movieRunTime": "1h 49min", "movieStoryLine": "A bomb attack in a cinema in Palermo kills all the fellows of Attardi's clan a part from Cocchi.

Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. Frank's newest transport seems no different from the countless ones he's done in the past. He's been hired by an American known only as \"Wall Street\" to make a delivery; but when Frank stops along the route, he notices his package is moving. Violating Rule Three, Frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman. Frank's steadfast adherence to his other two rules--which make up his basic code of survival--also quickly fails, hurtling him and his new companion on a road leading to shocking secrets, deadly complications, and the last thing that Frank ever expected to come to believe: that rules are made to be broken. \u2014Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NDc2MDAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDc1NDY2._V1_QL75_UY562_CR5,0,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "2,712", "movieReleasedAt": "2002-10-23", "movieFilmingLocation": "Cassis, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, France", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0005458", "actorBirthName": "Jason Statham"}, {"actorId": "nm0795517", "actorBirthName": "Shu Qi"}, {"actorId": "nm0776580", "actorBirthName": "Matt Schulze"}], "movieGenres": ["Action", "Crime", "Thriller"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0000108", "writerBirthName": "Luc Besson"}, {"writerId": "nm0436543", "writerBirthName": "Robert Mark Kamen"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "FR", "countryName": "France"}, {"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0504642", "directorBirthName": "Louis Leterrier"}, {"directorId": "nm0477035", "directorBirthName": "Corey Yuen"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}, {"languageCode": "fr", "languageName": "French"}, {"languageCode": "cmn", "languageName": "Mandarin"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0048273", "companyName": "EuropaCorp"}, {"companyId": "co0079764", "companyName": "TF1 Films Production"}, {"companyId": "co0051228", "companyName": "Current Entertainment"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Frank Martin": {"actorId": "nm0005458", "actorBirthName": "Jason Statham"}, "Lai": {"actorId": "nm0795517", "actorBirthName": "Shu Qi"}, "Wall Street": {"actorId": "nm0776580", "actorBirthName": "Matt Schulze"}, "Inspector Tarconi": {"actorId": "nm0075710", "actorBirthName": "Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and"}, "Mr. Kwai": {"actorId": "nm0949521", "actorBirthName": "Ric Young"}, "Leader": {"actorId": "nm0709455", "actorBirthName": "Doug Rand"}, "Boss": {"actorId": "nm1226261", "actorBirthName": "Didier Saint Melin"}, "Thug 1": {"actorId": "nm0220969", "actorBirthName": "Tonio Descanvelle"}, "Thug 2": {"actorId": "nm1226239", "actorBirthName": "Laurent Desponds"}, "Thug 3": {"actorId": "nm1226236", "actorBirthName": "Matthieu Albertini"}, "Pilot": {"actorId": "nm0625936", "actorBirthName": "Vincent Nemeth"}, "Little Thug": {"actorId": "nm0082229", "actorBirthName": "Jean-Yves Bilien"}, "Giant Thug": {"actorId": "nm0661576", "actorBirthName": "Jean-Marie Paris"}, "Newscaster": {"actorId": "nm1226238", "actorBirthName": "Adrian Dearnell"}, "Cop 1": {"actorId": "nm0521411", "actorBirthName": "Alfred Lot"}, "Secretary": {"actorId": "nm1226270", "actorBirthName": "Audrey Hamm"}, "Wheel Man": {"actorId": "nm1226251", "actorBirthName": "Sebastien Migneau"}, "Young Thug": {"actorId": "nm0432397", "actorBirthName": "Laurent Jumeaucourt"}}}, {"movieId": "tt5936692", "movieTitle": "The Last Family", "movieRating": "7.5/10", "movieTrailer": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi484358169", "movieRunTime": "2h 3min", "movieStoryLine": "As renowned painter Zdzislaw Beksinski tapes everything with his beloved camcorder, a 28-year family saga unfolds through his disturbing dystopian paintings, family feuds, near-death experiences, love-hate relations and consecutive funerals.

The great freedoms of the United States are no longer, as the once great nation has sealed off its borders and become a militarized police state, censoring all film, art, literature, and communications. Even so, a small resistance force led by two revolutionaries manages to fight the oppression. With full control over the media, the government attempts to quell the nation's yearning for freedom by broadcasting a number of game shows on which convicted criminals fight for their lives. The most popular and sadistic of these programs is \"The Running Man,\" hosted by Damon Killian. When a peaceful protest of starving citizens gathers in Bakersfield, California, a police officer named Ben Richards is ordered to fire on the crowd, which he refuses to do. Subdued by the other officers, the attack is carried out, and Richards is framed for the murder of almost a hundred unarmed civilians. Following a daring jail break months later, Richards is captured once again and forced to appear on \"The Running Man\" with three other convicts. With their help, he fights his way through a cadre of sadistic gladiators hunting them down through the ruins of a Los Angeles earthquake, but promising Killian that he'll return to settle the score when the show's host double-crosses him. In the meantime, the contestants must search through the ruins for the resistance in the hopes of finally broadcasting the truth about the government. \u2014Curly Q.

Selma Jezkov\u00e1, a Czechoslovakian immigrant, and her preteen son Gene live in a rented trailer owned by and on the property of married Bill and Linda Houston, he the town sheriff. Beyond Bill and Linda, Selma has a small group of friends who look out for her, including her primary confidante, Kathy, with who she works, and Jeff who wants to be her boyfriend. Jeff regularly waits outside Selma's workplace long before the end of her shift to drive her home, despite she always refusing in not wanting to lead him on. Her primary job is working on the Anderson Tool factory assembly line, but she does whatever she can to earn money. What only Kathy knows among Selma's friends is that she is slowly going blind, her medical condition being genetic. Selma is barely able to see, just enough to do her job. Her primary reason for moving to the US and for working all the time is to earn enough money for an operation for Gene when he turns thirteen, he who doesn't know anything about his mother or his own degenerative eyesight. None of Selma's friends, not even Kathy, know about the money for Gene's operation. Beyond this sole goal of the operation, Selma allows only one indulgence in her life, anything having to do with musicals, which she loves, it an escape from the problems of her life. Kathy often takes her to the cinema to watch old musicals, Kathy who has to describe to Selma what is happening on the screen much to the other patrons' chagrin. Selma also has the lead of Maria in a community theater production of \"The Sound of Music\". Close to having enough money for the operation, Selma is in a race against time before she loses enough of her sight not to be able to work or participate in the musical production.

Her parents are divorced, with her father a virtually non-existent figure in her life and her EMT mother generally absent as she is always working to provide for Drey. Her older brother Mike is incarcerated for selling drugs for a local dealer named Frank. Mike took the fall for Frank, who in turn protects Drey whether she wants to be associated with him or not. Dan and Drey's relationship changes when Drey catches Dan, believing he is alone, smoking crack in the girl's locker room bathroom. He is totally stoned. Their resulting friendship, which is seen as inappropriate by the few who know, is based on each being unable to deal with their own life, but feeling like they can be at least a minor salvation in the other's life. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4ODg1OTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA3ODQzMQ@@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR3,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2007-07-18", "movieFilmingLocation": "Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0331516", "actorBirthName": "Ryan Gosling"}, {"actorId": "nm1107001", "actorBirthName": "Anthony Mackie"}, {"actorId": "nm1560274", "actorBirthName": "Shareeka Epps"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0281396", "writerBirthName": "Ryan Fleck"}, {"writerId": "nm1349818", "writerBirthName": "Anna Boden"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0281396", "directorBirthName": "Ryan Fleck"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0144109", "companyName": "Hunting Lane Films"}, {"companyId": "co0065292", "companyName": "Journeyman Pictures"}, {"companyId": "co0156876", "companyName": "Silverwood Films"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Dan Dunne": {"actorId": "nm0331516", "actorBirthName": "Ryan Gosling"}, "Frank": {"actorId": "nm1107001", "actorBirthName": "Anthony Mackie"}, "Drey": {"actorId": "nm1560274", "actorBirthName": "Shareeka Epps"}, "Roodly": {"actorId": "nm2575873", "actorBirthName": "Jeff Lima"}, "Terrance": {"actorId": "nm1736913", "actorBirthName": "Nathan Corbett"}, "Stacy": {"actorId": "nm2579560", "actorBirthName": "Tyra Kwao-Vovo"}, "Gina": {"actorId": "nm2579223", "actorBirthName": "Rosemary Ledee"}, "Jamal": {"actorId": "nm2080933", "actorBirthName": "Tristan Mack Wilds"}, "Bernard": {"actorId": "nm2107385", "actorBirthName": "Bryce Silver"}, "Lena": {"actorId": "nm2581699", "actorBirthName": "Kaela C.

The payroll belongs to the silver mine in Silvertown. The three drifter thieves are Billy Joe Cuddler, Preacher and his assistant, an African-American demobilized soldier. The payroll is in the care of mine engineer Ben Novack who just arrived from Europe and must report for work at the mine in Silvertown. After the theft of the payroll is discovered at the stagecoach's arrival in Silvertown, everyone is puzzled about its disappearance but the money is insured and a replacement payroll is sent for. After grumbling about the delay in receiving their wages, the miners return to work. However, the mine owner, James Cooper, orders Ben Novack to work with town sheriff John Ferguson in finding the culprits. Happy at not being suspected of theft, Billy Joe Cuddler and his two pals plan another payroll theft. They also plan to steal the mine's silver shipment en route to the federal silver depository. In the meantime, the three drifter pals ingratiate themselves with the townsfolk. They even become heroes of sorts when they save the stagecoach from an attack by a numerous gang of bandits led by notorious cut-throat outlaw Burton. When Sheriff John Ferguson is wounded during the attack, drifter Billy Joe Cuddler is asked to temporarily fill-in the job of lawman, to the surprise and amusement of his two pals. Billy Joe Cuddler becomes temporary sheriff but he still plans to steal the next mine payroll and the mine's silver shipment at the first opportunity. Unknown to all of them is the fact that outlaw Burton and his gang plan to attack the town in force during the upcoming town fiesta and seize the mine's silver shipment. \u2014nufs68", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdmNTljMzUtMmM3Yi00OTVjLThmOGEtYWUxMGRkMDZhZmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU5OTg5NDc@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,49,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1969-08-06", "movieFilmingLocation": "Desierto de Tabernas, Almer\u00eda, Andaluc\u00eda, Spain", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0001812", "actorBirthName": "Lee Van Cleef"}, {"actorId": "nm0004646", "actorBirthName": "Antonio Sabato"}, {"actorId": "nm0593369", "actorBirthName": "Gordon Mitchell"}], "movieGenres": ["Western"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0754575", "writerBirthName": "Warren Kiefer"}, {"writerId": "nm0738247", "writerBirthName": "Mino Roli"}, {"writerId": "nm0824216", "writerBirthName": "Giorgio Stegani"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "IT", "countryName": "Italy"}, {"countryCode": "XWG", "countryName": "West Germany"}, {"countryCode": "MC", "countryName": "Monaco"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0824216", "directorBirthName": "Giorgio Stegani"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "it", "languageName": "Italian"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0076073", "companyName": "Roxy Film"}, {"companyId": "co0069579", "companyName": "Sancrosiap"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Billy Joe Cudlip": {"actorId": "nm0001812", "actorBirthName": "Lee Van Cleef"}, "Ben Novack": {"actorId": "nm0004646", "actorBirthName": "Antonio Sabato"}, "Burton": {"actorId": "nm0593369", "actorBirthName": "Gordon Mitchell"}, "Preacher": {"actorId": "nm0822034", "actorBirthName": "Lionel Stander"}, "James Cooper": {"actorId": "nm0817881", "actorBirthName": "Bud Spencer"}, "Sally Davis": {"actorId": "nm0334676", "actorBirthName": "Graziella Granata"}, "Eustaccio": {"actorId": "nm0299439", "actorBirthName": "Herbert Fux"}, "Bandit #2": {"actorId": "nm0300520", "actorBirthName": "Carlo Gaddi"}, "Lola": {"actorId": "nm0037327", "actorBirthName": "Valentina Arrigoni"}, "Sheriff John Ferguson": {"actorId": "nm0276417", "actorBirthName": "Enzo Fiermonte"}, "Mr. Davis": {"actorId": "nm0255887", "actorBirthName": "Hans Elwenspoek"}, "Hotel owner": {"actorId": "nm0264811", "actorBirthName": "Adriana Facchetti"}, "Sam - Burton Bandit": {"actorId": "nm0057269", "actorBirthName": "Romano Puppo"}, "Burton's Right Hand": {"actorId": "nm0831512", "actorBirthName": "G\u00fcnther Stoll"}, "Old Man in Stagecoach": {"actorId": "nm0632452", "actorBirthName": "Nino Nini"}, "Diego - Burton Henchman": {"actorId": "nm0082306", "actorBirthName": "Salvatore Billa"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0064747", "movieTitle": "Le cercueil vivant", "movieRating": "6.0/10", "movieRunTime": "1h 36min", "movieStoryLine": "In the end of the Nineteenth Century, the aristocrat Edward Markham is disfigured by sorcery in Africa by the natives.

After his request for parole is denied despite he being a model prisoner, Doc, unable emotionally to endure life inside, asks his loving wife Carol McCoy to contact crooked businessman Jack Beynon, a man with political connections, to secure his release in return for he being \"for sale\" to Beynon. Beynon is able to get Doc released, the sale price being for Doc to plan and execute a robbery at a small bank branch in Beacon City, Texas where Beynon knows that $750,000 will be kept in the vault for the next two weeks. Rather than Doc using his own men for the job, Beynon directs that the only other people involved will be the men of his own choosing, Rudy and Frank. There are to be no casualties, which is all right with Doc who is not a murderer. After the robbery is completed and the monies divvied up accordingly, Doc and Carol will cross the border into Mexico to live out their lives away from capture. The robbery doesn't come off quite according to Doc's plan, with the result being Doc and Carol going on the run as they try to make their way into Mexico with their share of the loot. Various people are in their pursuit, some who know that they will try to cross into Mexico at one of the two major West Texas border crossings. Other bystanders get directly or indirectly involved in the proceedings, which affects what happens. Two of those people, seeming straight-laced couple Fran and Harold Clinton, get involved more intimately than would have been first anticipated. Though it all, Doc and Carol have to work through some of their own issues, which arise out of a revelation about Doc's release from prison. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU1NDNmZTAtNDlhYy00MmY0LTlhMWUtZGNiNzA2ODA5MDY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,8,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "4,281", "movieReleasedAt": "1973-01-25", "movieFilmingLocation": "El Paso, Texas, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0000537", "actorBirthName": "Steve McQueen"}, {"actorId": "nm0532298", "actorBirthName": "Ali MacGraw"}, {"actorId": "nm0424565", "actorBirthName": "Ben Johnson"}], "movieGenres": ["Action", "Crime", "Thriller"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0001353", "writerBirthName": "Walter Hill"}, {"writerId": "nm0860292", "writerBirthName": "Jim Thompson"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0001603", "directorBirthName": "Sam Peckinpah"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}, {"languageCode": "es", "languageName": "Spanish"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0051510", "companyName": "David Foster Productions"}, {"companyId": "co0102269", "companyName": "First Artists"}, {"companyId": "co0229191", "companyName": "Foster-Brower Productions"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Doc McCoy": {"actorId": "nm0000537", "actorBirthName": "Steve McQueen"}, "Carol McCoy": {"actorId": "nm0532298", "actorBirthName": "Ali MacGraw"}, "Jack Beynon": {"actorId": "nm0424565", "actorBirthName": "Ben Johnson"}, "Fran Clinton": {"actorId": "nm0001783", "actorBirthName": "Sally Struthers"}, "Rudy Butler": {"actorId": "nm0504803", "actorBirthName": "Al Lettieri"}, "Cowboy": {"actorId": "nm0001620", "actorBirthName": "Slim Pickens"}, "The Thief": {"actorId": "nm0109175", "actorBirthName": "Richard Bright"}, "Harold Clinton": {"actorId": "nm0230284", "actorBirthName": "Jack Dodson"}, "Laughlin": {"actorId": "nm0852305", "actorBirthName": "Dub Taylor"}, "Frank Jackson": {"actorId": "nm0005019", "actorBirthName": "Bo Hopkins"}, "Cully": {"actorId": "nm0421772", "actorBirthName": "Roy Jenson"}, "The Accountant": {"actorId": "nm0117461", "actorBirthName": "John Bryson"}, "Swain": {"actorId": "nm0366159", "actorBirthName": "Bill Hart"}, "Hayhoe": {"actorId": "nm0750364", "actorBirthName": "Tom Runyon"}, "The Soldier": {"actorId": "nm0429454", "actorBirthName": "Whitney Jones"}, "Boy on the Train": {"actorId": "nm0858949", "actorBirthName": "Ivan Thomas"}, "Boy's Mother": {"actorId": "nm0924566", "actorBirthName": "C.W.

They are con artists, whose scam is for her to jump alongside moving vehicles feigning being hit and injured, while he, playing the outraged husband, negotiates with the worried driver for an unofficial cash settlement in return for not calling the police reporting the motorist's \"guilt\". She often does sustain minor injuries from the ruse. She believes that they will continue doing this work until they have enough money to settle down in one place, where he will get a legitimate job. However, he wants to continue the scam indefinitely as he, a veteran, claims that injuries he sustained during the war would prevent him from obtaining that legitimate work. When Toshio reaches age ten in 1966, they enlist him in the con, he now playing the accident victim, with Takeko now playing the concerned mother role. They even manufacture real bruises on Toshio to make the scam more convincing. Like his stepmother before him, Toshio increasingly gets real injuries doing this work. This work takes its toll on their already dysfunctional family, that dysfunction which includes lies, and physical and emotional abuse by both Takeko but most specifically Takeo. That increasing dysfunction is also due to the fact that Takeko learns that she's pregnant again. She wants to keep the baby if only because it will force them to settle down, while he wants her to abort the pregnancy. Toshio has no true perspective of love or life, he only knowing that they need money to live, this work which is the only way he knows to obtain money. He does begin to get a sense that what they are doing is wrong when he witnesses a boy only slightly older than him being extorted for money from older bullies. As an emotional escape, Toshio often thinks about running away, which may not be difficult as his parents allow him free reign while they deal with their own priorities. Toshio also immerses him and his younger brother in a fantasy world where he is an alien from the Andromeda nebula come to Earth to kill all the evildoers of the world. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NiNjA4MzktYTBiOC00ZjZjLThkMzYtNThhY2VlMDRlMjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIyNzY1NzM@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR15,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1970-01-30", "movieFilmingLocation": "Akita, Japan", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0913796", "actorBirthName": "Fumio Watanabe"}, {"actorId": "nm0468699", "actorBirthName": "Akiko Koyama"}, {"actorId": "nm0008383", "actorBirthName": "Toshi Amatsu"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0848797", "writerBirthName": "Tsutomu Tamura"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "JP", "countryName": "Japan"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0651915", "directorBirthName": "Nagisa \u00d4shima"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "ja", "languageName": "Japanese"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0005137", "companyName": "Art Theatre Guild (ATG)"}, {"companyId": "co0073251", "companyName": "Sozosha"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Takeo Omura": {"actorId": "nm0913796", "actorBirthName": "Fumio Watanabe"}, "Takeko Taniguchi": {"actorId": "nm0468699", "actorBirthName": "Akiko Koyama"}, "Toshio Omura": {"actorId": "nm0008383", "actorBirthName": "Toshi Amatsu"}, "Peewee": {"actorId": "nm0455849", "actorBirthName": "Tsuyoshi Kinoshita"}, "Victim driver": {"actorId": "nm0229520", "actorBirthName": "Do-yun Yu"}}}, {"movieId": "tt6040662", "movieTitle": "My Lady", "movieRating": "6.7/10", "movieTrailer": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2677390105", "movieRunTime": "1h 45min", "movieStoryLine": "As her marriage to Jack Faye (Stanley Tucci) flounders, eminent High Court judge Fiona Maye (Dame Emma Thompson) has a life-changing decision to make at work - should she force a teenage boy, Adam Henry (Fionn Whitehead), to have the blood transfusion that will save his life?

Zubeida is a Muslim actress, who's career aspirations are thwarted by her film-producer father (Puri) who looks down upon a woman in acting. He arranges her marriage to her friend's son, but that breaks up after the birth of her son. Zubeida is now back at her parent's home, sad and depressed. Rose (Lilette Dubey) her father's mistress tries to cheer-up Zubeida by taking her out. On one of these outings, Zubeida meets Prince Vijayendra (Victor) Singh of Fatehpur (Bajpai). Quite taken with her, the Prince woos and marries her. Zubeida, now the 2nd wife of a Hindu prince, leaves her son behind with her mother (Sikri) and comes to live at Fatehpur. Here she meets the much older Mandira Devi (Rekha) the Prince's first wife, learns about the etiquette of being a Rani, and of the duties her husband has towards his first wife. Zubeida's relationship with Mandira (whom she calls Mandy didi) is tumultuous, seesawing between affection and jealousy. She frets about the restrictions on her as Rani and the choke-hold of royal duties on Victor, often venting out her frustrations at not having her husband to herself. When Victor decides to contest the elections, he relies on Mandira, as his Hindu consort (as opposed to Zubeida), to accompany him on his political jaunts. Zubeida, angry at being spurned, in obstinacy takes a decision, which has fatal consequences. \u2014Amodini", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE1ZjBlZDEtZGJjMS00ZjIzLTlmZWEtNGMzODlmZDJkMTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR9,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2001-01-19", "movieFilmingLocation": "Film City, Goregaon, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0006433", "actorBirthName": "Karisma Kapoor"}, {"actorId": "nm0004334", "actorBirthName": "Rekha"}, {"actorId": "nm0048075", "actorBirthName": "Manoj Bajpayee"}], "movieGenres": ["Biography", "Drama", "History", "Musical", "Romance"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0006659", "writerBirthName": "Khalid Mohamed"}, {"writerId": "nm0796503", "writerBirthName": "Javed Siddiqui"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "IN", "countryName": "India"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0070867", "directorBirthName": "Shyam Benegal"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "hi", "languageName": "Hindi"}, {"languageCode": "ur", "languageName": "Urdu"}, {"languageCode": "raj", "languageName": "Rajasthani"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0109037", "companyName": "F.K.R.

The men and women who put country before self, the men and women who define our history because they give a damn! Ajay (played by Akshay Kumar) is one such officer who is part of an elite team chosen from amongst the best in the Forces to form a covert Counter Intelligence Unit. In the course of foiling one terrorist attack bid, Ajay discovers a major threat to our nation - a plan to cause damage and strike fear at the heart of our very existence. The plot is masterminded by a maniacal leader whose organization has its tentacles spread across the world. As days progress, the unit goes through escalating challenges with time ticking against them and risks escalating. At all points, the members of the unit give it all they've got and stand tall to guard us with all their strength so that we may sleep safe in our homes.

Tawny Madison (a role which consisted solely of repeating what the computer stated, much to Gwen's chagrin), Shakespearean trained Sir Alexander Dane as alien Dr. Lazarus, Fred Kwan as engineer Tech Sergeant Chen, and Tommy Webber as child pilot Laredo. Eighteen years after the series last aired, it lives on in the hearts of its rabid fans. However, it lives on in infamy for its stars, who have not been able to find meaningful acting work since. Their current lives revolve around cashing in on however those roles will afford, which usually entails attending fan conventions or worse, such as electronic store openings. Only Jason seems to relish his lot in life, until he finds out that his co-stars detest him because of his superior attitude as \"the Commander\", and much of the public considers him a laughing stock. Their lives change when Jason is approached by who he thinks are convention fans asking for help. They are in reality an alien race called Thermians, led by Mathesar, who have modeled their existence after the series, which they believe to be real. When Jason and then the rest of his co-stars (along with Guy Fleegman, who was killed off before the opening credits in only one episode) go along with the Thermians, Jason's co-stars who believe they are off to yet another paying gig, they learn that they have to portray their roles for real. Without screenwriters to get them to a happy and heroic ending, they have to trust that their play acting will work, especially in dealing with the Thermians' nemesis, General Sarris. Guy in particular fears that he will go the way his character did on the series. But when they run across technical issues that they as actors didn't care anything about during the filming of the series and thus now don't know how to deal with, they need to find someone who should know what to do. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmZlNTY5YjQtZTU5ZC00MzcyLWI1NDMtNjA0ZjQxMmQwYjJmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR9,0,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "806", "movieReleasedAt": "2000-10-04", "movieFilmingLocation": "Goblin Valley State Park, Utah, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0000741", "actorBirthName": "Tim Allen"}, {"actorId": "nm0000244", "actorBirthName": "Sigourney Weaver"}, {"actorId": "nm0000614", "actorBirthName": "Alan Rickman"}], "movieGenres": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Sci-Fi"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0397232", "writerBirthName": "David Howard"}, {"writerId": "nm0330565", "writerBirthName": "Robert Gordon"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0661751", "directorBirthName": "Dean Parisot"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0819670", "companyName": "Dreamworks Pictures"}, {"companyId": "co0071947", "companyName": "Gran Via Productions"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Jason Nesmith": {"actorId": "nm0000741", "actorBirthName": "Tim Allen"}, "Gwen DeMarco": {"actorId": "nm0000244", "actorBirthName": "Sigourney Weaver"}, "Alexander Dane": {"actorId": "nm0000614", "actorBirthName": "Alan Rickman"}, "Fred Kwan": {"actorId": "nm0001724", "actorBirthName": "Tony Shalhoub"}, "Guy Fleegman": {"actorId": "nm0005377", "actorBirthName": "Sam Rockwell"}, "Tommy Webber": {"actorId": "nm0593258", "actorBirthName": "Daryl Mitchell"}, "Mathesar": {"actorId": "nm0170186", "actorBirthName": "Enrico Colantoni"}, "Sarris": {"actorId": "nm0755179", "actorBirthName": "Robin Sachs"}, "Quellek": {"actorId": "nm0106755", "actorBirthName": "Patrick Breen"}, "Laliari": {"actorId": "nm0701512", "actorBirthName": "Missi Pyle"}, "Teb": {"actorId": "nm0715915", "actorBirthName": "Jed Rees"}, "Brandon": {"actorId": "nm0519043", "actorBirthName": "Justin Long"}, "Kyle": {"actorId": "nm0397386", "actorBirthName": "Jeremy Howard"}, "Katelyn": {"actorId": "nm0191636", "actorBirthName": "Kaitlin Cullum"}, "Hollister": {"actorId": "nm0275502", "actorBirthName": "Jonathan Feyer"}, "Young Tommy": {"actorId": "nm0088298", "actorBirthName": "Corbin Bleu"}, "Lathe": {"actorId": "nm0701818", "actorBirthName": "Wayne P\u00e9re"}, "Neru": {"actorId": "nm0516127", "actorBirthName": "Sam Lloyd"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0297037", "movieTitle": "Brown Sugar", "movieRating": "6.5/10", "movieTrailer": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1371275545", "movieRunTime": "1h 49min", "movieStoryLine": "This romantic comedy centers on a romance between an A&R exec, Dre, at a hip-hop label and a magazine editor, Sidney, who have known each other since childhood..

One of his hires is Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), who is quickly promoted to Assistant Director and was Hoover's confidant and companion for the rest of Hoover's life. Hoover's memories have him playing a greater role in the many high profile cases in which the F.B.I. was involved, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, the arrest of bank robbers like John Dillinger, and also show him to be quite adept at manipulating the various politicians with whom he worked over his career, thanks in large part to his secret files. \u2014garykmcd", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDM4ODU2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ0NTg4Ng@@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,12,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "3,757", "movieReleasedAt": "2012-01-11", "movieFilmingLocation": "Warrenton, Virginia, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0000138", "actorBirthName": "Leonardo DiCaprio"}, {"actorId": "nm2309517", "actorBirthName": "Armie Hammer"}, {"actorId": "nm0915208", "actorBirthName": "Naomi Watts"}], "movieGenres": ["Biography", "Drama", "Romance"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0085257", "writerBirthName": "Dustin Lance Black"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0000142", "directorBirthName": "Clint Eastwood"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0003687", "companyName": "Imagine Entertainment"}, {"companyId": "co0010258", "companyName": "Malpaso Productions"}, {"companyId": "co0265519", "companyName": "Wintergreen Productions"}], "movieTopCasting": {"J.

He and Assaf, who write together on the school newspaper, the Tides Gazette, are each other's only true friend at the school - Dash the alpha between the two - no one in the school who reads the paper. The only other person with who they associate is Verti, the paper's editor. The school year doesn't start as Dash would hope as not only are he and Assaf and by association the newspaper as ignored as they were last year, but Assaf has found a new alpha in his life, namely Verti as the two embark on a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. But Dash ends up discovering something in the school's archives which has the potential to change fundamentally the nature of the school in its entirety, the story, which he wants to expose, at its core the corruption of school authority. With this information, Dash, who may know better than most what to do if his prediction comes to fruition to save the school and the lives of his classmates, has to find his voice, which he may be able to do with some others who he least expects. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1ODk0NzEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ2MzQ1MTI@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR2,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2017-06-18", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0005403", "actorBirthName": "Jason Schwartzman"}, {"actorId": "nm2551886", "actorBirthName": "Reggie Watts"}, {"actorId": "nm3713920", "actorBirthName": "Adam Lustick"}], "movieGenres": ["Animation", "Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Thriller"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm2690651", "writerBirthName": "Dash Shaw"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm2690651", "directorBirthName": "Dash Shaw"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0092503", "companyName": "Washington Square Films"}, {"companyId": "co0575839", "companyName": "Electric Chinoland"}, {"companyId": "co0378460", "companyName": "Low Spark Films"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Dash Shaw": {"actorId": "nm0005403", "actorBirthName": "Jason Schwartzman"}, "Assaf Shoaib": {"actorId": "nm2551886", "actorBirthName": "Reggie Watts"}, "Benji": {"actorId": "nm3713920", "actorBirthName": "Adam Lustick"}, "Drake": {"actorId": "nm1493163", "actorBirthName": "Alex Karpovsky"}, "Mary": {"actorId": "nm2501633", "actorBirthName": "Lena Dunham"}, "Gretchen": {"actorId": "nm2106801", "actorBirthName": "Louisa Krause"}, "Lunch Lady Lorraine": {"actorId": "nm0000215", "actorBirthName": "Susan Sarandon"}, "Verti Sharpe": {"actorId": "nm0748973", "actorBirthName": "Maya Rudolph"}, "Mrs. Brinson": {"actorId": "nm0553269", "actorBirthName": "Margo Martindale"}, "Principal Grimm": {"actorId": "nm0752876", "actorBirthName": "Thomas Jay Ryan"}, "Librarian": {"actorId": "nm3026487", "actorBirthName": "Jennifer Kim"}, "Construction Worker": {"actorId": "nm5505923", "actorBirthName": "Dan Lippert"}, "Gymnastics Teen #1": {"actorId": "nm4223018", "actorBirthName": "Emily Davis"}, "Gymnastics Teen #2": {"actorId": "nm9958940", "actorBirthName": "Erin Lackey"}, "Gymnastics Teen #3": {"actorId": "nm9958941", "actorBirthName": "Emily Bolecek"}, "Senior Kyle": {"actorId": "nm0536866", "actorBirthName": "Matthew Maher"}, "Brent Daniels": {"actorId": "nm0593463", "actorBirthName": "John Cameron Mitchell"}, "Senior Craig": {"actorId": "nm1133042", "actorBirthName": "Keith Poulson"}}}, {"movieId": "tt1667439", "movieTitle": "Private Peaceful", "movieRating": "6.2/10", "movieTrailer": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3335955481", "movieRunTime": "1h 42min", "movieStoryLine": "Private Peaceful details the gritty rural lives and loves of Tommo and Charlie - two young brothers - and their poor Devonshire family from 1909 until 1916, when the outbreak of war destroys their country idyll.

Upon regaining consciousness, Jack learns to his astonishment that he is apparently now the only one who knows the music of the Beatles.

There is narration by a continuing character, Kari. The first segment of the film revolves around the first encounter with a digimon and a fight that occurs between their digimon and another. The two kids, Kari and Tai, raise a fast-growing digimon from an egg to a large, dinosaur-like digimon, which escapes from their house and then has an encounter and a battle with a parrot-like digimon. The second segment mainly involves Tai and another digiDestined friend of his, Izzy. A computer virus sweeps across the internet, effecting a digiEgg, and thus creating an infected digimon. This infected digimon begins to start eating computer information and data, and the two protagonists attempt to stop the digimon, but fail. After the infected digimon manages to get into the American information system and launch two nukes, one at japan and one at Colorado, Tai and Izzy get help from teammates Matt and his little brother T.K. They successfully overcome the infected digimon and prevent the nukes from detonating. The third and final segment involves Kari and T.K., now years older, as they see a kid and two digimon fighting whilst in New York. Kari and T.K decide to follow the child, who turns out to be the creator of the virus, and, after meeting up with friends, they manage to defeat the evil digimon, who turns out to be one of Willis' twin digimon that was affected by the virus following the actions of the second segment. Together they fight against this infected digimon, and destroy the virus that was affecting Willis' digimon. \u2014Leo", "moviePosterUrl":

Jason's criminology professor, Mr. Harris, will only allow Jason to write his paper on Gacy if Jason can come up with a fresh angle, as he himself believes the topic of serial killers is already overexposed. After writing Gacy a nondescript letter and receiving a questionnaire from Gacy in return, Jason believes the fresh angle would be truly to get inside Gacy's head, specifically to learn what makes him tick, by presenting himself in subsequent correspondence to Gacy as Gacy's \"type\", i.e. a vulnerable young man from a dysfunctional family and thus who is possibly at risk. Despite the advice that he needs to watch out for cunning Gacy, Jason is certain he can outsmart the serial criminal at his own game. Things take an unexpected turn for Jason when he starts receiving telephone calls from Gacy, who was able to find out his number. As Jason feels he has to do further field work based on things that Gacy wants him to report back on, Jason may find that he is not as well equipped emotionally to handle the situation than he first believed, potentially leading to serious consequences both for himself and those around him. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl":

Bront\u00eb and Georges expect never having to see each other again until they file for divorce and have each gotten what they want out of the marriage. The reason for Georges wanting to be married: he, an aspiring composer who has been is the States for five months, has long overstayed his tourist visa, and wants to be a permanent resident to get his green card, marrying an American which will solve that issue. The reason for Bront\u00eb wanting to get married: she, a horticulturist, needs to be married to be accepted as the new tenant for her dream apartment, which contains a greenhouse with a collection of exotic but currently neglected plants, plus an expansive patio where she can grow plants for her research. Their plans are thrown for a loop when representatives from immigration services make a surprise visit to Bront\u00eb's new apartment - supposedly her and Georges' new apartment - in a clampdown on such marriages of convenience which constitute fraud. As such, they are advised by Bront\u00eb's lawyer for Georges to move into the apartment until their final hearing with immigration services, during which time they have to get to know each other to convince immigration services that their marriage truly is one not based on convenience. Spending time together may be difficult for both Georges but most specifically Bront\u00eb as they try to hide the fact of their marriage from her friends and family, including her parents with their own idiosyncrasies, and her current boyfriend Phil with who she works, which means keeping them away from the apartment, the building managers who know her only as Mrs. Faur\u00e9 and not Miss Parrish. But the biggest issue may be overcoming their fundamental differences as humans, they as roommates who may deep in their heart want to kill the other more than what they want out of the marriage. They may find that the ultimate end prize is not what would happen after a successful meeting with the immigration representatives. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl":

special bond with each other since they were kids when their parents were tragically killed in a car accident. That bond is why single mom Sammy, who still lives in the family home in Scottsville, upstate New York with her eight year old son Rudy, is excited to hear that Terry, who she has not seen or heard from in a while, is coming home for a visit. That excitement is dampened slightly upon Terry's arrival, when she learns that he, broke, is only there to borrow money. As adults, Sammy, who works as a lending officer in the local bank, is seen as the responsible sibling, while unfocused Terry is seen as the irresponsible drifter. Regardless, Sammy welcomes what ends up being Terry's longer than planned visit if only so that he can help take care of Rudy, who has no adult male figure in his life. Rudy has never known his deadbeat biological father, with whom Sammy wants nothing to do. As Terry - acting as the supposed adult male role model figure - gets to know Rudy, and as Sammy deals with the issues in her life which includes figuring out what her relationship to longtime friend/lover Bob Steegerson means, and how to deal with her straight-laced micro-managing new boss Brian Everett, the maturity level between Sammy and Terry is not as far apart as it appears on the surface. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTNmZGNkODUtZWZhMi00NGMwLWEzZWMtNTEzNzU3ZmUxNWZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyOTc@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2001-06-20", "movieFilmingLocation": "Margaretville, New York, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0001473", "actorBirthName": "Laura Linney"}, {"actorId": "nm0000111", "actorBirthName": "Matthew Broderick"}, {"actorId": "nm0752407", "actorBirthName": "Amy Ryan"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0518836", "writerBirthName": "Kenneth Lonergan"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0518836", "directorBirthName": "Kenneth Lonergan"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0071970", "companyName": "Hart Sharp Entertainment"}, {"companyId": "co0011179", "companyName": "Cappa Production"}, {"companyId": "co0015544", "companyName": "Crush Entertainment"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Sammy": {"actorId": "nm0001473", "actorBirthName": "Laura Linney"}, "Brian": {"actorId": "nm0000111", "actorBirthName": "Matthew Broderick"}, "Mrs. Prescott": {"actorId": "nm0752407", "actorBirthName": "Amy Ryan"}, "Mr. Prescott": {"actorId": "nm0183613", "actorBirthName": "Michael Countryman"}, "Sheriff Darryl": {"actorId": "nm0480775", "actorBirthName": "Adam LeFevre"}, "Amy": {"actorId": "nm0270546", "actorBirthName": "Halley Feiffer"}, "Young Sammy": {"actorId": "nm0888574", "actorBirthName": "Whitney Vance"}, "Young Terry": {"actorId": "nm0450136", "actorBirthName": "Peter Kerwin"}, "Minister": {"actorId": "nm0014483", "actorBirthName": "Betsy Aidem"}, "Rudy": {"actorId": "nm0191412", "actorBirthName": "Rory Culkin"}, "Mabel": {"actorId": "nm0810397", "actorBirthName": "J.

This plot twist brings human folly and cynicism into sharp focus. \u2014Bruce Cameron <dumarest@midcoast.com>", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjVlYzNkZjQtYjlkZi00MjNiLTgyNTMtYWVmYzNiYzJiNTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUyNjYzNTE@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,7,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1993-02-10", "movieFilmingLocation": "Colobane, Senegal", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0228087", "actorBirthName": "Mansour Diouf"}, {"actorId": "nm0224460", "actorBirthName": "Ami Diakhate"}, {"actorId": "nm1767814", "actorBirthName": "Faly Gueye"}], "movieGenres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0246959", "writerBirthName": "Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt"}, {"writerId": "nm0228013", "writerBirthName": "Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "CH", "countryName": "Switzerland"}, {"countryCode": "FR", "countryName": "France"}, {"countryCode": "SN", "countryName": "Senegal"}, {"countryCode": "GB", "countryName": "United Kingdom"}, {"countryCode": "NL", "countryName": "Netherlands"}, {"countryCode": "IT", "countryName": "Italy"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0228013", "directorBirthName": "Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "wo", "languageName": "Wolof"}, {"languageCode": "fr", "languageName": "French"}, {"languageCode": "ja", "languageName": "Japanese"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0015678", "companyName": "Thelma Film AG"}, {"companyId": "co0063193", "companyName": "ADR Productions"}, {"companyId": "co0050171", "companyName": "Maag Daan"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Draman Drameh": {"actorId": "nm0228087", "actorBirthName": "Mansour Diouf"}, "Lingu\u00e8re Ramatou": {"actorId": "nm0224460", "actorBirthName": "Ami Diakhate"}, "Mme Drameh": {"actorId": "nm1767814", "actorBirthName": "Faly Gueye"}, "Le maire": {"actorId": "nm1767108", "actorBirthName": "Mamadou Mahour\u00e9dia Gueye"}, "Le chef fu protocole": {"actorId": "nm11033846", "actorBirthName": "Omar Ba"}, "Le professeur": {"actorId": "nm1767480", "actorBirthName": "Issa Samb"}, "Le pr\u00eatre": {"actorId": "nm1767050", "actorBirthName": "Calgou Fall"}, "Toko": {"actorId": "nm11033847", "actorBirthName": "Kaoru Egushi"}, "Le juge": {"actorId": "nm0228013", "actorBirthName": "Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty"}, "Le seigneur de la plume": {"actorId": "nm11033848", "actorBirthName": "Mbaba Diop"}, "Le m\u00e9decin": {"actorId": "nm0228014", "actorBirthName": "Abdoulaye Diop"}, "La femme du maire": {"actorId": "nm11033849", "actorBirthName": "Rama Thiaw"}, "La danseuse": {"actorId": "nm0970102", "actorBirthName": "Oumi Samb"}, "Amazone": {"actorId": "nm0360509", "actorBirthName": "Tcheley Hanny"}}}, {"movieId": "tt1716772", "movieTitle": "Les Boloss - Inbetweeners, le film", "movieRating": "6.7/10", "movieTrailer": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1293002009", "movieRunTime": "1h 37min", "movieStoryLine": "Best friends Will McKenzie, Simon Cooper, Jay Cartwright and Neil Sutherland - who are not among the social outcasts, but also not cool enough to hang out with the cool kids who they aspire to be - have just graduated from their suburban London high school. Simon has finally been able to get Carli D'Amato, who he has been in love with since they were children, to be his girlfriend. Largely because they will be going away to different schools in the fall, Carli breaks up with him. To get Simon's singularly focused mind off Carli, his three best mates decide to take him on vacation for two weeks to get some sun, sand and girls before they move onto the next chapter of their lives in the fall. Neil makes the decision for them to go to Malia on the isle of Crete, a popular summer tourist destination for many a Brit. Jay, with inheritance money in hand, believes he can have the pick of any girl he wants. Neil has to decide what constitutes not cheating on his girlfriend, Nicole. Will wants to add a bit of culture into the vacation. And Simon still pines for Carli, getting her off his mind being more difficult when he learns why Neil chose Malia. What starts off as a disastrous vacation has the potential to pick up when they meet fellow Brits Alison, Lucy, Jane and Lisa, who pair up with Will, Simon, Jay and Neil respectively, and with who they hang, out of circumstance, for much of their time in Malia. Will the virgin, who generally makes Alison laugh, has no chance with her as she is far out of his league, and as she is already in a serious relationship with a Greek waiter named Nicos. Jay is ashamed to be seen with self-assured Jane, because she is overweight. Neil treats Lisa like any other female with who he wants to have non-cheating \"sex\". And Simon may not see that Lucy really does like him despite his singular focus on Carli. All these issues are placed against the backdrop of the guys trying to get tickets for the all-day boat cruise, seen as the party of the season, and at which all their dreams - at least in their dreams - will come true. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTAyNmQyNjItYmQ0OS00ZGVkLTk3NTItYTE2YjkxNTkxZWU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,4,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "4,284", "movieReleasedAt": "2011-12-21", "movieFilmingLocation": "Malia, Crete, Greece", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0118617", "actorBirthName": "James Buckley"}, {"actorId": "nm3002919", "actorBirthName": "Blake Harrison"}, {"actorId": "nm3022504", "actorBirthName": "Joe Thomas"}], "movieGenres": ["Comedy"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0606597", "writerBirthName": "Iain Morris"}, {"writerId": "nm1720648", "writerBirthName": "Damon Beesley"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "GB", "countryName": "United Kingdom"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm1414582", "directorBirthName": "Ben Palmer"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0197272", "companyName": "Film4"}, {"companyId": "co0185138", "companyName": "Young Films"}, {"companyId": "co0186328", "companyName": "Bwark Productions"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Jay Cartwright": {"actorId": "nm0118617", "actorBirthName": "James Buckley"}, "Neil Sutherland": {"actorId": "nm3002919", "actorBirthName": "Blake Harrison"}, "Simon Cooper": {"actorId": "nm3022504", "actorBirthName": "Joe Thomas"}, "Will McKenzie": {"actorId": "nm3020713", "actorBirthName": "Simon Bird"}, "Carli D'Amato": {"actorId": "nm2113191", "actorBirthName": "Emily Head"}, "Jane": {"actorId": "nm3617801", "actorBirthName": "Lydia Rose Bewley"}, "Alison": {"actorId": "nm2652095", "actorBirthName": "Laura Haddock"}, "Lucy": {"actorId": "nm4309809", "actorBirthName": "Tamla Kari"}, "Lisa": {"actorId": "nm2198800", "actorBirthName": "Jessica Knappett"}, "Richard": {"actorId": "nm3174795", "actorBirthName": "Theo Barklem-Biggs"}, "James": {"actorId": "nm3772243", "actorBirthName": "Theo James"}, "Will's Dad": {"actorId": "nm0372117", "actorBirthName": "Anthony Head"}, "Mrs. Cartwright": {"actorId": "nm0932219", "actorBirthName": "Victoria Willing"}, "Phil Gilbert": {"actorId": "nm1829595", "actorBirthName": "Greg Davies"}, "Mark Donovan": {"actorId": "nm1631222", "actorBirthName": "Henry Lloyd-Hughes"}, "Polly McKenzie": {"actorId": "nm0829134", "actorBirthName": "Belinda Stewart-Wilson"}, "Pamela Cooper": {"actorId": "nm0915948", "actorBirthName": "Robin Weaver"}, "Alan Cooper": {"actorId": "nm0872040", "actorBirthName": "Martin Trenaman"}}}, {"movieId": "tt3283556", "movieTitle": "Land Ho!", "movieRating": "6.0/10", "movieTrailer": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3661478425", "movieRunTime": "1h 35min", "movieStoryLine": "A pair of ex-brothers-in-law set off to Iceland in an attempt to reclaim their youth through Reykjavik nightclubs, trendy spas, and rugged campsites.

Entering a windowless room, an Invigilator gives them eighty minutes to answer one simple question. He outlines three rules they must obey or be disqualified: don't talk to him or the armed guard by the door, don't spoil their papers and don't leave the room. He starts the clock and leaves. The candidates turn over their question papers, only to find they're completely blank. After the initial confusion has subsided, one frustrated candidate writes 'I believe I deserve...,' and is promptly ejected for spoiling. The remaining candidates soon figure out they're permitted to talk to each other, and they agree to cooperate in order to figure out the question: then they can compete to answer it. At first they suspect the question may be hidden in their papers like a security marker in a credit card, and they figure out ways to change their environment to expose the hidden words. But light, liquids and other plans all come to naught. Soon enough, the candidates begin to uncover each other's background, prejudices and hidden agendas. Tensions rise as the clock steadily descends towards zero, and each candidate must decide how far they are willing to go to secure the ultimate job . . . \u2014Stuart Hazeldine", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg2NzM2NzIwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE2ODc1Mg@@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "4,054", "movieReleasedAt": "2012-10-03", "movieFilmingLocation": "Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England, UK", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm3065862", "actorBirthName": "Adar Beck"}, {"actorId": "nm2110418", "actorBirthName": "Gemma Chan"}, {"actorId": "nm1812523", "actorBirthName": "Nathalie Cox"}], "movieGenres": ["Mystery", "Thriller"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0371955", "writerBirthName": "Stuart Hazeldine"}, {"writerId": "nm3089840", "writerBirthName": "Simon Garrity"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "GB", "countryName": "United Kingdom"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0371955", "directorBirthName": "Stuart Hazeldine"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}, {"languageCode": "fr", "languageName": "French"}, {"languageCode": "yue", "languageName": "Cantonese"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0242010", "companyName": "Hazeldine Films"}, {"companyId": "co0095111", "companyName": "Bedlam Productions"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Dark": {"actorId": "nm3065862", "actorBirthName": "Adar Beck"}, "Chinese Girl": {"actorId": "nm2110418", "actorBirthName": "Gemma Chan"}, "Blonde": {"actorId": "nm1812523", "actorBirthName": "Nathalie Cox"}, "Deaf": {"actorId": "nm1125878", "actorBirthName": "John Lloyd Fillingham"}, "Black": {"actorId": "nm1030244", "actorBirthName": "Chukwudi Iwuji"}, "Brunette": {"actorId": "nm1717573", "actorBirthName": "Pollyanna McIntosh"}, "White": {"actorId": "nm0531101", "actorBirthName": "Luke Mably"}, "Brown": {"actorId": "nm0592993", "actorBirthName": "Jimi Mistry"}, "The Invigilator": {"actorId": "nm0758760", "actorBirthName": "Colin Salmon"}, "The Guard": {"actorId": "nm1362415", "actorBirthName": "Chris Carey"}}}, {"movieId": "tt11731768", "movieTitle": "Ka Pae Ranasingam", "movieRating": "7.4/10", "movieTrailer": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1290322201", "movieRunTime": "2h 57min", "movieStoryLine": "The story is about politics surrounding land and the plight of farmers.

His only companion is his cook cum confidant Babu (Baburaj). Manu Raghav (Asif Ali) is Kalidasan's nephew and he comes to his uncle's place, while searching for a job. Kalidasan's boring life gets an altogether different twist with a wrong call from Maya (Shweta Menon), a spinster who is a dubbing artiste, living as a paying guest with her friend Meenakshi (Mythili). It all starts when Maya dials for a dosa and gets Kalidasan on line, instead of the food joint. As expected, the initial conversations between these two unusual characters create negative vibes and are peppered with choice abuses, but a long-distance romance develops because they have a similar interest-cooking and food. If Kalidasan is a born foodie, Maya is reaching for her late mother by indulging in culinary activities which evoke a sense of deep nostalgia in her. Having struck up an affinity over the telephone, Kalidasan proceeds to let Maya into the secrets of baking a Joan's Rainbow Cake. The plot develops naturally as their conversations help to etch their characters. They both get the jitters before their first personal meeting and become conscious of their physical appearances. So, they send younger and better looking substitutes for the meeting in the form of Manu and Meenakshi. This creates misunderstandings, confusion and conflict which is resolved at the end. \u2014Wikipedia", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NhNzEzMTEtNjg5MC00MmEyLTk0NTctMmNlNmQxNjI5MzkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM0ODk5MDU@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR21,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2011-07-08", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0482309", "actorBirthName": "Lal"}, {"actorId": "nm0579769", "actorBirthName": "Shweta Menon"}, {"actorId": "nm1560523", "actorBirthName": "Mythili"}], "movieGenres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm4543222", "writerBirthName": "Dileesh Nair"}, {"writerId": "nm4544331", "writerBirthName": "Syam Pushkaran"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "IN", "countryName": "India"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm3351235", "directorBirthName": "Aashiq Abu"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "ml", "languageName": "Malayalam"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0346600", "companyName": "Lucsam Cinema"}, {"companyId": "co0346618", "companyName": "Lucsam Creations"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Kalathipparampil Kalidasan": {"actorId": "nm0482309", "actorBirthName": "Lal"}, "Maya Krishnan": {"actorId": "nm2366511", "actorBirthName": "Bhagyalakshmi"}, "Meenakshi": {"actorId": "nm1560523", "actorBirthName": "Mythili"}, "Manu": {"actorId": "nm3981484", "actorBirthName": "Asif Ali"}, "Babu": {"actorId": "nm2055008", "actorBirthName": "Baburaj"}, "Balakrishnan": {"actorId": "nm1066795", "actorBirthName": "Vijayaraghavan"}, "Maria Aunty": {"actorId": "nm1427780", "actorBirthName": "Kalpana"}, "K.T.

His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than \"Riggan Thomson\" the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name, what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project, and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night, Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name, Mike Shiner, for that role, Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter, Sam, who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson, who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggan's biggest problem may be his own insecurities, which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character, who he often battles both internally and externally. \u2014Huggo", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAzNDMxMzAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxMjA4MjE@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "890", "movieReleasedAt": "2015-02-25", "movieFilmingLocation": "Rum House, Hotel Edison, 228W, 47th Street, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0000474", "actorBirthName": "Michael Keaton"}, {"actorId": "nm0302108", "actorBirthName": "Zach Galifianakis"}, {"actorId": "nm0001570", "actorBirthName": "Edward Norton"}], "movieGenres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0327944", "writerBirthName": "Alejandro G.

Having lost their parents to an accident at a very early age, they live with their uncle and aunt. Chotu is blind but he is anything but sad. Happy, precocious and a smart ass, he is the life of the village.Pari is his eyes, his guide and his best friend. And Chotu is the center of Pari's universe. As children sometimes do, not truly understanding the consequences, Pari has promised Chotu that he will be able to see by the time he turns 9 and as always, Chotu believes her unconditionally. On their weekly trip to the neighboring village to see a movie, Pari sees a poster with Sharukh Khan (SRK) appealing to people to donate their eyes. Pari is convinced that her reel life hero can help her fulfill her promise to her brother. In all her innocence she writes a letter to SRK pleading Chotu's case and to hurry since Chotu's 9th birth is just two months away. She doesn't hear back but this doesn't deter her and she writes a letter to SRK every day. One day fate intervenes - Pari hears that SRK is shooting in a location about 300 kms from her village. This is all the motivation she needs. She is confident that if she can meet SRK in person, she is sure that she can convince him to make Chotu see again. In the dead of the night, holding Chotu's hand, she runs away from home and embarks on a great adventure to meet SRK. What unfolds is a magical journey that only the innocence of childhood allows you to experience in the special world of children who have the ability to see magic in every little corner of this complicated world. They meet a host of colorful characters who sometimes help and sometimes thwart their plan but always push them in right path towards their destination! Will they make it? Will Chotu ever see again? Will fortune favor the bold? Step out and make this wondrous journey with Chotu and Pari and believe once again that if one wishes with atrue heart anything is possible. \u2014Nagesh Kukunoor", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVhMjA1ZTAtNWU4OC00Y2E5LTllNjctNzdjMmZkNzdhMjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR10,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "2016-06-17", "movieFilmingLocation": "Rajasthan, India", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm7095931", "actorBirthName": "Krrish Chhabria"}, {"actorId": "nm6818979", "actorBirthName": "Hetal Gada"}, {"actorId": "nm1479650", "actorBirthName": "Vipin Sharma"}], "movieGenres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0474398", "writerBirthName": "Nagesh Kukunoor"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "IN", "countryName": "India"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0474398", "directorBirthName": "Nagesh Kukunoor"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "hi", "languageName": "Hindi"}, {"languageCode": "raj", "languageName": "Rajasthani"}, {"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0534634", "companyName": "Drishyam Films"}, {"companyId": "co0352643", "companyName": "Kukunoor Movies"}, {"companyId": "co0518982", "companyName": "Manish Realities"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Chotu": {"actorId": "nm7095931", "actorBirthName": "Krrish Chhabria"}, "Pari": {"actorId": "nm6818979", "actorBirthName": "Hetal Gada"}, "Dungaram": {"actorId": "nm1479650", "actorBirthName": "Vipin Sharma"}, "Gowri": {"actorId": "nm4740190", "actorBirthName": "Gulfam Khan"}, "Madan Mohan": {"actorId": "nm8395399", "actorBirthName": "Idhant Singh"}, "Bully": {"actorId": "nm6819040", "actorBirthName": "Swastik Ram Chavan"}, "Bathposh": {"actorId": "nm8395400", "actorBirthName": "Narendar Singh Rajpurohit"}, "Post-Master": {"actorId": "nm6819037", "actorBirthName": "Vincent Daniel"}, "Aashaji": {"actorId": "nm8395401", "actorBirthName": "Harmeet Arora"}, "Phoolan": {"actorId": "nm6829465", "actorBirthName": "Sanjana Singh"}, "Gardu": {"actorId": "nm4399478", "actorBirthName": "Rajiv Laxman"}, "Truck driver": {"actorId": "nm2363187", "actorBirthName": "Rishi Deshpande"}, "Drunk man": {"actorId": "nm1238337", "actorBirthName": "Vijay Maurya"}, "Samsher Singh": {"actorId": "nm6819038", "actorBirthName": "Pratyaksh Kalra"}, "Jeep passenger": {"actorId": "nm6819039", "actorBirthName": "Subramani Ramachandran"}, "Jeep Driver": {"actorId": "nm8395402", "actorBirthName": "Chiranjeet Chhabria"}, "Saffron Robed Man": {"actorId": "nm8395403", "actorBirthName": "Rahul Lohani"}, "Bus conductor": {"actorId": "nm8395404", "actorBirthName": "Kelash Daangi"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0124879", "movieTitle": "Simon Birch", "movieRating": "6.9/10", "movieRunTime": "1h 54min", "movieStoryLine": "Simon Birch tells the story of Joe and Simon's heart-warming journey of friendship.

Over the years, Nikolas's former adoptive families become many, and soon almost every house has presents on its doorstep on Christmas morning.

He is scarcely seated in a quiet corner when a hideous, shriveled-up old man taps him upon the shoulder and whispers vaguely of a big inheritance for Prague's finest swordsman and wildest student if he will enter into a certain agreement. Balduin rebuffs him, satirically asking his weird companion to procure him \"the luckiest ticket in a lottery or a doweried wife.\" The old man goes off chuckling and thence onward persistently shadows Balduin, exerting a sinister influence over him, while Balduin is still disconsolate under the frowns of fortune. The Countess Margit Schwarzenberg, hunting with her cousin, to whom her father has betrothed her, meets with an accident. She is thrown over her horse's head into a river, but Balduin, who has been directed to the spot by his evil genius, plunges in and rescues her. Subsequently Balduin calls to inquire as to her condition at the castle of her father, the count, but be makes a hurried departure when Baron Waldis arrives, the contrast in their appearance discrediting him. His desire to win the countess and to humiliate the baron becomes so pronounced that he readily accedes to the compact suggested by Scapinelli, the old man, who has so pertinaciously dogged his footsteps, particularly when he learns that untold wealth and power will be his when he assigns to the other the right to take from his room whatever he chooses for his own use as he desires. The agreement is signed. Balduin receives a shower of gold and notes as his portion; Scapinelli takes Balduin's soul exposed in concrete form by his shadow. Balduin prosecutes his love affair assiduously and with apparent success, till the baron is informed of it by a jealous gypsy girl. He challenges Balduin to a duel, and the latter, assured of his superiority as a fencer, readily agrees. Count Schwarzenberg learns of the impending duel and appeals to Balduin not to kill \"my sister's child, my daughter's future husband, and my heir.\" Balduin gives his promise, but when he goes to the venue of the duel he meets, his own counterpart stalking away derisively wiping his gory sword on his cloak. Balduin turns and in the far distance sees the dying victim of the deed he swore he would not do. He rushes from the spot horror-stricken. When he regains sufficient composure he makes his way to the castle of the count, but is refused admission. Determined to explain that he had no complicity in the death of the baron, Balduin climbs into a room in which the countess is seated. She receives him coldly, but soon succumbs to his ardent wooing. Just as he seeks to leave her she notices he has no shadow and that the mirror gives no reflection of him; and she drops back affrighted, the ghastly apparition of himself which takes shape in the corner of the room sends Balduin scuttling away from the castle in a paroxysm of terror. He makes a frenzied flight through a woodland estate and the streets of Prague, but wherever he stops to recover his breath he is haunted by the counterpart of himself. He reaches his rooms and draws a murderous looking fire-arm from its case. As the phantasmagorical figure strides towards him with a sinister grin, he fires, and in a few minutes the blood gushes from his own side from a fatal wound. \u2014Moving Picture World synopsis", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU4MGZiMmItOWJlOC00NDlkLWIyODItYjI5OWNmNmQyMDUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzg1ODEwNQ@@._V1_QL75_UY562_CR23,0,380,562_.jpg", "movieReleasedAt": "1913-08-22", "movieFilmingLocation": "Hradschin, Prague, Czech Republic", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0917467", "actorBirthName": "Paul Wegener"}, {"actorId": "nm0074186", "actorBirthName": "Grete Berger"}, {"actorId": "nm0758802", "actorBirthName": "Lyda Salmonova"}], "movieGenres": ["Drama", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Romance"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0263912", "writerBirthName": "Hanns Heinz Ewers"}, {"writerId": "nm0210503", "writerBirthName": "Alfred de Musset"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "DE", "countryName": "Germany"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0917467", "directorBirthName": "Paul Wegener"}, {"directorId": "nm0753233", "directorBirthName": "Stellan Rye"}], "movieLanguages": [{"languageCode": "de", "languageName": "German"}, {"languageCode": "en", "languageName": "English"}], "movieProductionCompanies": [{"companyId": "co0064793", "companyName": "Deutsche Bioscop GmbH"}], "movieTopCasting": {"Balduin, a Student": {"actorId": "nm0917467", "actorBirthName": "Paul Wegener"}, "Countess Margit von Schwarzenberg": {"actorId": "nm0074186", "actorBirthName": "Grete Berger"}, "Lyduschka, a Gypsy Girl": {"actorId": "nm0758802", "actorBirthName": "Lyda Salmonova"}, "Scapinelli, an Old Sorcerer": {"actorId": "nm0332024", "actorBirthName": "John Gottowt"}, "Count von Schwarzenberg, Margit's Father": {"actorId": "nm0477996", "actorBirthName": "Lothar K\u00f6rner"}, "Baron Waldis-Schwarzenberg, Margit's Cousin, betrothed": {"actorId": "nm0917744", "actorBirthName": "Fritz Weidemann"}, "Self - with wide-brimmed hat at Belvedere": {"actorId": "nm0263912", "actorBirthName": "Hanns Heinz Ewers"}, "Self - with cap at Belvedere": {"actorId": "nm0596218", "actorBirthName": "Alexander Moissi"}}}, {"movieId": "tt0158610", "movieTitle": "Kako je propao rokenrol", "movieRating": "8.1/10", "movieRunTime": "1h 46min", "movieStoryLine": "Omnibus film, consisting of three independent parts: in the first story, Koma, a failed rocker, wants to prove to his producer father that newly composed music could be better than his.

The explosion, although botched, was set up by a select group of the French Interior Ministry as a decoy so they can make a half billion dollar digital transfer from a bank (closed on French National Day) -- hence the title Bastille Day.

Charri\u00e8re - nicknamed Papillon because of his butterfly tattoo - and Louis Dega are two among many who have been convicted in the French judicial system, they now being transferred to French Guyana where they will serve their time, never to return to France even if they are ever released. A safe-cracker by criminal profession, Papillon is serving a life sentence for murdering a pimp, a crime for which he adamantly states he was framed. Dega is a wealthy counterfeiter, who expects his well-to-do wife eventually to get him released. At Papillon's initiative, the duo enters into a business arrangement: Papillon will provide protection for Dega, who, in turn, will finance Papillon's escape attempt. As the two men spend more time together than either had expected, their burgeoning friendship ends up being an important factor altering their original plans, needed as they work with and against others who are trying to achieve their own goals, sometime conflicting with those of Papillon and Dega. \u2014Huggo/RMS", "moviePosterUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRjZjQ0NzAtYmZlNS00Zjc1LTk1YWItMDY5YzQxMzA4MTAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,9,380,562_.jpg", "moviePopularity": "3,080", "movieReleasedAt": "1974-02-06", "movieFilmingLocation": "St Laurent du Maroni, Guyane, D\u00e9partements d'Outre-Mer, France", "movieStars": [{"actorId": "nm0000537", "actorBirthName": "Steve McQueen"}, {"actorId": "nm0000163", "actorBirthName": "Dustin Hoffman"}, {"actorId": "nm0430460", "actorBirthName": "Victor Jory"}], "movieGenres": ["Biography", "Crime", "Drama"], "movieWriters": [{"writerId": "nm0874308", "writerBirthName": "Dalton Trumbo"}, {"writerId": "nm0783913", "writerBirthName": "Lorenzo Semple Jr."}, {"writerId": "nm0153508", "writerBirthName": "Henri Charri\u00e8re"}], "movieOrigins": [{"countryCode": "FR", "countryName": "France"}, {"countryCode": "US", "countryName": "United States"}], "movieDirectors": [{"directorId": "nm0769874", "directorBirthName": "Franklin J.
